"You realize the number of Olympic gold medals you have doesn't actually translate to your ranking in your sport right? Especially in a sport like skiing, where anything can happen? Look at Mikaela Shiffrin in the slalom (still the best slalom skier in the world). 

She's hyped because she has won 81 world cup events (the most of any woman), won a world cup in all 5 events (one of only 6 women to ever do that), won 10 World Championship and Olympic medals, and has been the overall World Cup champion 4 times, and three of them were consecutive years.
