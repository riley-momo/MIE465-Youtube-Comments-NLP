"Lets face it, commercial status influences most minds. I mean if one of you no name producers made this beat and just put it on youtube, most people wouldn't think much about it, maybe a few likes and haters and even some ""friends"" would clown like ""Pssh, this guys thinks he's a producer. Beat is whatever"". But if that exact same beat was bought by Kendrick Lamer and it hit the radio, all of a sudden poeple would be like ""Oh that beat is my shit!"" and everyone would like you. SMH.
