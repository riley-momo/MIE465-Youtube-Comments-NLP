"Give yourself a break, Jessica.  While you are pregnant and even several months to a year after that adorable baby girl comes, just do what you feel like doing.  Maybe you need to not do as many videos each week until after birth; your subscribers will understand, especially the ones who have had babies because that along takes a toll on your body.  I had 3 pregnancies and with my middle daughter, I'd read to her while I was pregnant and guess what?  She's an avid reader now.  I just didn't think to do it with my first one and then forgot to do it with my 3rd one.  God bless you.",0.8957,124

Where I live we do not have large department stores like Macy's, Nordstrom, etc. If Ulta or Sephora does not carry a product could  you please tell where you can find the product? My Walmart does not carry Milani products and some other products you mention as drug store. We do have CVS and Walgreens. For example, in one of your videos you mentioned Charlotte Tilbury. Where would I purchase it? I'd much rather see the product in person that having to return it online if it doesn't work. Hope this makes sense. Thanks.

"One more thing.... Don't read pregnancy / books/Web stuff if you are going too be reading all the time in a couple reasons
1) your just going to think of the worst poss things is going to happen and your just going to stress over nothing 
2) your going to miss allot while you're face is inside your book ... My advice is put down the book and live in the sec ...even with your pregnancy . one day your kid(s) will be 15yrs old and you will look back at your pregnancy and a part of you will remember some stuff.... Mainly cause the stuff you remember will be a mostly Around Pain, weight gain, swollen feet, the first movement (s) your baby moves And there LITTLE personally  , your bladder issues and the rest most people forget to remember to sit down and relax enjoy being Prego .... Take time for yourself and make time for your relationship make sure you ARE straightening your marriage cause when baby comes you. Wont have the Time and or ability to take Time and have just you and hubby time alone . when your a  new parent(s) your going to get on each other's  nerve And Your marriage will be tested SO STRAIGHTEN YOUR MARRIAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. .  (i was once told it this way; your body is the THE BOAT IS: 

THE BOAT:
YOUR MARRIAGE IS A BOAT LOST AT SEE

With both my pregnancies I gained about 40-50 lbs. my husband wasn’t able to feel either baby until around 26-30 weeks. Talk about the baby as much as you want. She is a big part/ your life now. I still have pregnancy brain and my baby is about to be 10 months.,0.4404,60

You are precious!!! I love your videos and really trust your reviews! Enjoy this time being pregnant (cannot lie I did not love being pregnant-and I had super easy pregnancies even with my twins). And you are spot on about everyone elses advice. It's there if you need it and can be forgotten when you don't. Thank you for being a positive influence and being so sweet! And I love that you said you felt awkward---I can only imagine! Best of luck from KY!,0.9926,96

You're beautiful on the inside and out. Congrats on your pregnancy I'm so happy for you and wish you all the best. Little girls are so fun. I have two nieces and two nephews and little boys are so different from little girls. I'm living vicariously through my sisters as I can't have children of my own. Enjoy every minute...and lock up your makeup. I caught my nieces digging into my hourglass bronzer with a massive brush...gentle is not the word I would use to describe her actions. When she saw that she was caught she quickly dropped it and smashed the brush onto her cheek and rubbed it all offer her face. If it wasn't so funny I would have been upset. Haha,0.977,137
