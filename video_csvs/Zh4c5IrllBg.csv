"AAAAACCTTUUUAAALLLYYYY The public never GOT to go to Jurassic Park. The entire first movie was Dr. Hammond showing a bunch of scientists the park in a preview run in hopes they would sign off on it. The entire thing went to shit before the public even knew the park existed. Sure, one could argue that the T-Rex attack on San Francisco in The Lost World would make people think dinos are unsafe, but knowing InGen, I bet they covered that up to the rest of the world. Jurassic World was the first actual park open to the public and at the beginning of the movie they said that they had been operating there safely for years.

For all the Children who are Ruined by shame 
Mirror child
The image of a precious dove
Dancing barefoot on the beach
Drinking in love and sunshine
full of smiles 
never having to die.
 
Mere child 
Dreaming awhile on a school title 
Learning to carry books for miles. 
Crayons, pencils, stencils 
Nothing you need to do
but Sing and carry the wind on Your wings.
 
Mirror child
Like daddy or mommy
Carrying so many burdens
for A little person
All the time
 
Not able To catch the spies and Spiders. 
Go back to the skies, 
Little dove
And play with the eagles 
who tamed this land 
Until you are a spirit so good and pure
That you will truly guide 
the directions of our 
Bloodied hands.
 
Temptations of Evil 
Muscles of Clay,
Eyes of pitifully empty bliss,
Teeth of dragons never begotten, 
You stand alone 
Praying to brainless demons
Praising power empty Of Spirit, 
Goodness or Hope. 
 
You shall reap no Glory
But only Mortal death 
and baptized Shame
So as to Die without Jesus 
Or any Holy Name. 
 
Stained by lust,
Broken tears and stardom,
Born of evil and deviltries
Ill conceived 
Raise Your Heart to God Jesus
and The Holy Spirit,
And He will Remove Your Pain, 
Stop your foolish self destructive reign,
And bring you Spiritual Relief 
You could never possibly or individually 
Humanly gain.
 
To Have Peace, Love 
And Eternal Happiness and Justice
For All People,
Believe in Jesus,
The Son of Mary and God, 
And You Will Be Immortally
Saved For ever more,
And Be Loved
By Our Holy Father God 
For all Eternity.

I am actually very satisfied with the theory but I saw that the I-rex was white before it escaped so I thought that what if the dino cooled itself before camouflaging,0.2609,31
I can believe it. While the novels and the films are clearly differnt universes this would be a logical way to expand Wu's character from how he was in the book.
