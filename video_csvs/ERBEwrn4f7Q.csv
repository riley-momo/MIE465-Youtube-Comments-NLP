First of the ciber crystal can be any colour. It depends on the Jedi or sith. If you are more skilled towards the force you will have a green blade. If you are more skilled with your lightsaber you will get a blue blade. If you are a sith you have to make your crystal bleed which causes the red affect. Mace Windu was able to tap into the light and the dark side of the force which gave him the purple blade.,0.0,89
