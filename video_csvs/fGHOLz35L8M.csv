"It’s so sad seeing people breeding dogs for money and the growing away the mother like trash. I live in Sweden and I have never heard anything like this happening here but then we don’t sell cats or dogs in pet stores either it’s considered animal cruelty to do that. Adoption is good but comes with a lot of different responsibility due that the animals might need special care and usually have some trauma. But if you want to buy a puppy there is some things you can do so that you buy from a responsible breeder, responsible breeders gladly show you the mother and if the father is there him too but also they will ask you questions on how you live and if you have had a puppy before. They will be more than happy to know the puppy when it’s full grown and keep contact. Also ask for breeding permit usually they have one.",0.9597,172

So the breeder could not earn money with her, it,s all about money and prestige, we had another rescue black labrador at that time too, she had have enough litters of puppies, so also no longer of use to make money. Disgusting breeders.But when they come and live with us, they get all the care and love of the world, go on vacation etc.If only all the poor poor sweet dogs and other animals would have a good live....... i feel so bad for these poor dogs , cats etc who are treated like carbage, thank for al the people who save them and give them care and love !",0.9699,168
