I 100% know you're full of shit. And you clearly justify this slander to yourself, because you think, hey, if i talk about my fictional rape experiences for attention, i'm helping women everywhere. I'm basically jesus. But no--you're only helping teenage sociopaths like you who promote victim culture as a means of getting their 15 minutes of fame.

We all knew Louie was a pervert. That was not news. I'm sure he's crossed the line before, his entire stage persona is that of a habitual line crosser. But these guilty until proven innocent witchhunts, target good and talented men with sensationalist populism. The whole ""#metoo"" movement (and i doubt anything that claims to be socially progressive that starts with a hashtag) is about the mentality ganging up and thinking ""if we get enough women to accuse this guy, we can destroy his entire life without a trial."" Telling women they're not alone isn't a recipe for tolerance, its a recipe for mob mentalities. Thats not progress, thats ochlocracy. Thats shirley fucking jackson's the lottery. You pieces of shit think you're above the law... You want to accuse a man of rape? LET THE FUCKING COURTS DECIDE. Let a fucking jury of your peers decide. Don't poison the well and destroy a mans entire career before you've even gone to trial. Lets say the man WAS a rapist. He should still fucking walk, because at this point with the way public perception has turned on him like a bunch of hungry jackels... There is literally no way to ensure a fair and impartial jury.
