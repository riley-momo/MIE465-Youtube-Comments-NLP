Jerusalem is the holiest city in Judaism, always have, always will. But it's only considered the third holiest site for Muslims, after Mecca and Medina (both in Saudi Arabia)

Jerusalem is not once mentioned in the Quran. It only mentions the mosque Al-Aqsa, which means ""the Farthest Mosque"", when Muhammad went on a journey on a Buraq (a winged horse with the head of a man, smaller than a mule but bigger than a donkey), ascended Heaven, then descended back to Earth and then went back to the Mecca (again, on his Buraq)

Meanwhile, Jerusalem is mentioned 669 times in the Hebrew Bible, where it is explicitly stated that Jerusalem is the capital of the Kingdom of Israel, created by King David and where his son Solomon built the first Beit Hamikdash (on the exact place where it was rebuilt after its destruction, and where the Al Aqsa mosque now stands)",0.2617,224

"Isaiah 11 Then it will happen on that day that the Lord will again recover the second time with His hand the remnant of His people who will remain,
From Assyria, Egypt, Pathros, Cush, Elam, Shinar, Hamath,
And from the islands of the sea. ( USA, Canada..... )
12 And He will lift up a standard for the nations
And assemble the banished ones of Israel,
And will gather the dispersed of Judah
From the four corners of the earth.

 The covenant to Israel from God has not changed because it is eternal. From the Nile to the Euphrates

Genesis 15:17 It came about when the sun had set, that it was very dark, and behold, there appeared a smoking oven and a flaming torch which passed between these pieces. 18 On that day the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying,

“To your descendants I have given this land,
From the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river Euphrates:

 Psalm 105 He has remembered His covenant forever,
The word which He commanded to a thousand generations,
9 The covenant which He made with Abraham,
And His oath to Isaac.
10 Then He confirmed it to Jacob for a statute,
To Israel as an everlasting covenant,
11 Saying, “To you I will give the land of Canaan
As the portion of your inheritance,”

Hosea 6 “Come, let us return to the Lord.
For He has torn us, but He will heal us;
He has wounded us, but He will bandage us.
2 “He will revive us after two days ( 2000 years. );
He will raise us up on the third day ( 1000 Reign of Messiah ),
That we may live before Him.

 Isaiah 49 "" But Zion ( Israel ) said, “The Lord has forsaken me,
And the Lord has forgotten me.”
15 “Can a woman forget her nursing child
And have no compassion on the son of her womb?
Even these may forget, but I will not forget you.
16 “Behold, I HAVE INSCRIBED YOU ON THE PALMS OF MY HANDS;
Your walls are continually before Me.
17 “Your builders hurry ( to restore Israel );
Your destroyers and devastators
Will depart from you.“Lift up your eyes and look around;
All of them gather together, they come to you.
As I live,” declares the Lord,
“You will surely put on all of them as jewels and bind them on as a bride ( Jews coming to Israel ).
19 “For your waste and desolate places and your destroyed land—
Surely now you will be too cramped for the inhabitants,
And those who swallowed you ( Israel's enemies ) will be far away.
20 “The children of whom you were bereaved will yet say in your ears,
‘The place is too cramped for me;
Make room for me that I may live here.’
21 “Then you will say in your heart,
‘Who has begotten these for me,
Since I have been bereaved of my children
And am barren, an exile and a wanderer?
And who has reared these?
Behold, I was left alone;
From where did these come?’” 
Understand why muslims hate muslims. Isaiah 49: 25 "" Surely, thus says the Lord,
“Even the captives of the mighty man will be taken away,
And the prey of the tyrant will be rescued ( Jews will be rescued );
For I will contend with the one who contends with you, ( God fights against Israel's enemies )
And I will save your sons.
26 “I will feed your oppressors with their own flesh,
And they will become drunk with their own blood as with sweet wine; ( muslim fighting muslims )
And all flesh will know that I, the Lord, am your Savior
And your Redeemer, the Mighty One of JACOB, ISRAEL ).”

"Shalom Aleichem
I say shalom, but don't get me wrong, when I say, you are not qualified to comment on Yisrael, Jews, The State of Israel, Evereet Yehudah, don't get offended by my word equations, many who attempt to sum up ""Aelian Capitolina and Palestina"" with a modern day opinion based in non learn propagandize based ideology, taught in ignorance through Church doctrine, has lead humanity into a direction without direction. As long as one is lead by the 5 senses, then one can never be qualified to understand such a MYSTERY based in INFINITY!

The populace has been lead down a path beyond the 1ST & 2nd commandment, for a very long time, whereas the 1st cause has been placed in a comfort zone, where carnality has become AN INTERIM virtual reality effect, where fleecing flesh occupant energy sources, uninfluenced too and by true purpose, which has not been received, much less administered by those qualified in the modern day, to teach it, are imprisoned!

So then, the adversarial mission becomes as the scripture teaches   ""forseeming"" it has endured without stopping since the EIN GEDI rebellion (The Garden).

And its not the fault of flesh animated spirits either,  its the fault of the commandment dodging populace, who despite final analysis examples, continue to follow the immorality based in an illusion based society, absent of the Torah as a constitution. Now this may sound like dogma, but, it isn't. 

When I mention Torah, I want to explain, that I do not relate to stories and verses of gossip and history, I relate  soley to the            61 3.......And if you don't know what I mean, it speaks to the point.

The UN, since you want to mention this systematizing machine, is not based in a moral based society, cognitive of its origin, its only interest is the scientific program, set in place by those who are running solar systems analysis for higher physical authorities and there interest.

What was granted at Sinai, endows the recipient with ""chokmat"", wisdom, only with this, will your eyes see beyond that which is perceived, and your ears will hear beyond that which has already been heard. For the 5 senses by which one perceives the world, can fool you, mastering the 6th sense is important in measuring material to light and carnal concepts to eternal ideals.

"There's too many things wrong with it to mention, it's just a low quality, low intellegence, very biased and intentionally a propoganda for fooling those who don't know enough. For example, and I'm copying from another comment on this video: ""Vox forgets to mention that the metal detectors were installed after two Druze (Israeli arabs who don't call themselves ""Palestinians"") Israeli police were gunned down by Palestinians with weapons brought to the Temple Mount. (Today) Jews and Christians are required to go through metal detectors but not the Muslims--another example of the double standard that exists. It is the Muslims that bring weapons and execute people but they are not restricted. Of course, metal detectors are required in other mosques world-wide. Look at Mecca--since Muslims once took over the mosque there, it has extraordinary security!""
