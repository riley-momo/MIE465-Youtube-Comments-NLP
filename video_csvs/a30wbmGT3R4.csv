Father is the word, the son is the body (flesh) and the Holy Ghost is spirit. sit next to a loose tarantula and tell me you don't shiver in the flesh. That is the spirit, the Holy Ghost directs you subconsciously. Now look at Jesus on the cross and what the word did to him. Fear the word and fear GOD.
