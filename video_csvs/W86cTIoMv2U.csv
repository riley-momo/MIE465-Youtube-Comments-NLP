"I don't understand why little housecats aren't more common. I mean we have dogs that fit into a purse. that's quite the drop from their wolf size ancestors. but almost all housecats are similar in size, roughly the size of their middle eastern ancestors. 
given how cute kittens are you would think that there would be at least a few tiny housecat species but it seems there was no effort made to bread these so far. weird. id like myself a cat that fits in my hand forever.",0.8097,96
