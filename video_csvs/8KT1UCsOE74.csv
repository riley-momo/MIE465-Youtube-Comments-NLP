"Biggest problem witht the movie was the weak character development, still trynna find some reviewer talking about it. (the villain is weak as fuck yes, but most villains are weak in these recent movies, not that it's an excuse, just that i can look past it as long as they give us good super heroes)

SPOILERS 



Like, i loved how they start to portray cyborg and his story and his conflict, but then it's just dropped all together, basically joins the team because the bad guys kindap his father... He doesn't resolve his problems or get any development he just joins cus of his father. And i have a HUGE problem with this cus at the end you feel that his conflict is resolved, he didn't know if he should be alive, he didn't know if he was a bad guy, he can't even control his powers, at the end you feel like he can and he knows he can use his powers for good and he doesn't feel bad about having them anymore, but you don't really get any moments that tell you this, he just joins the team, acts kinda distant (and even that is just once or twice), aquaman brings up his conflict sometimes but like there's no payoff at all, by the end it's just resolved, just like that!

The flash barely gets any development, he wants friends and he's kinda unsure of himself as a hero, and the first part is kinda ok, you get a few scenes of him trying to conect with the other heroes and by the end he does, and for this one you do have a mini payoff where cyborg fist bumps him after refusing to do so earlier in the film (which is a good moment for BOTH of them) but it's never a driving point of the story, it's just used for some funny moments and by the end it's resolved. The second part which could be a great development for him he's glossed over and dealt with IN ONE SCENE, he basically tells batman he's unsure he's never been in a fight he doesn't know what to do, and you get this great scene where he tells him to save one person and then he'll know what to do and the flash just saves them all and then even helps in the fight, but it's like one scene and it's never adressed again, yeah i do like he still looks and acts unsure and has to be told what to do, but it doesn't feel like he developed at all, he was nervous and unsure, now e's not so nervous and unsure, there have some character development, it's just so weak could have been done a lot better.

Wonder woman has some conflict that could have been used so well but he's just thrown out the window. Basically she's been hiding, she doesn't want to lose her loved ones or really cause anyone to get killed so she hides and in the movie she has to come out from the shadows and become this beacon of hope like superman, and this could have been handled so well in a lot of ways, but it really isn't, basically she says she's afraid of leading the justice league, batman wants her to do it (cus you know batman ain't a leader at all) but she wants to stay hidden, ok so far so good, this is a good direction, but how do they resolve it? She ""leads"" the final assault... by doing nothing... all the leading she does is tell them to save batman and that's it and the movie just assumes we'll think she's leading now and has conquered her problem which is fucking ridicolous. Again like with cyborg there is absolutely no payoff.

Batman's conflict is ridicolous to say the least. Basically he feels guilty for superman's death and he resolves this by.... bringing superman back to life. OMG GENIUS WRITING! So he gets nothing basically. Another conflict batman could have had that would be a great driving force for the plot is that of teamwork, batman doesn't really work well with a team usually, so we could have that, but nope, that's just glossed over by alfred saying a few lines of ""good to see you're working in a team"" because since the begining of the freaking movie he has absolutely 0 problem of working in a team and it's all good....

And then we have aquaman. That's it, he exists, oh he joins the fight because it's his responsability because of some backstory we don't even know. He's in the movie basically",0.996,854

The best portrayal of Superman? Brandon Routh was a better Superman than this guy. Henry Cavill's Superman has no personality at all. He's not even a great actor. He diminishes Superman at every turn. And his CGI lip was painfully obvious when he spoke. It looked fine when he was just staring off angrily into the distance, but as soon as he moved his mouth, it was horrible. Like, so bad I can't even believe they did it.

I hated BvS, so I was kind of worried this could bad too, but nope, many of the things i hated about BvS were fixed in this one, like how it doesn't take itself too seriously and learns to have fun with itself.  The actions scenes were cool, the characters were likable for the most part, special effects were great, and as mentioned, it had its share of humor, which is what Man of Steel and BvS needed.  As far the flaws are, I pretty much agree with Chris on everything, the main enemy was pretty forgettable and while I did enjoyed his fight scenes, there was nothing memorable about him, just your generic bad guy wants to conquer the world and shit.  And yes, some characters like Cyborg and the Flash we don't hear enough of their backstory, which is why this movie should've been two hours and a half long instead of two.

"I personally give the movie a 3/5. 

Explanation: You have all these huge comic book characters in one movie and 2 hours just isn't enough for the movie to not feel rushed. The sad part is that what I've seen from the trailers, I got exactly what I was expecting. It was mediocre at best. The storyline was bland, Man of Steel's face looked very unnatural because of the CGI, although some people claim they barely noticed it. The fact that you had Superman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg, Flash, Batman, Aquaman and Steppenwolf in one movie, means most of them will have below average story developement. You canot develop a story of 7 major characters in under 2 hours, it doesn't work that way.

Personally I prefer the more serious, deep storylines and more gray-ish atmospheres and movie themes like we saw in Captain America: The First Avenger, that movie will still remain at the top off superhero movies for me. The Avengers were a bit better than Justice League, but not by much. I would much rather see them make a mini series Justice League, like the Band of Brothers series, which is still the best mini series to date. It would give the producers a great opportunity to develop each character's story one by one, then have the last 2 or 3 episodes that focus on the team as a whole. Sure it would take much longer, but I am convinced that the reception would be twice as good with the audience and critics.",0.9904,286

"I saw it last night and it was ok. I didn't really like what they did with Batman, The Flash and Steppenwolf. For The Flash i was expecting a Berry Allen who is a little older and has his shit together. Not an awkward teenager who got nervous a lot. Batman was a little bit weird. It's almost like he had no authority over the team at all. Also every time he smiled was weird. Some changes are kinda bad, especially with Lex Luthor but some changes are cool like what they did with Aquaman. The dude was a badass and he had funny moments too like when he was sitting on the lasso of truth. Steppenwolf was cool at first but when Superman showed up he was just a chump. Also the whole thing with removing Henry Cavil's mustache isn't as big deal as people made it out to be. I never noticed that his upper lip was off. But yeah i'd give it a 7/10, i like superhero movies and DC. But i didn't like how Batman and The Flash were done. I heard rumors that they'll recast Batman after they do Flashpoint because they wanted a younger guy which would be cool. Maybe The Flash will be replaced too. Don't get me wrong Ezra is a cool guy and he was funny in the movie but he just doesn't do it as The Flash.",0.8938,257

"Jesse Collins I gave enough information for somebody who knows absolutely nothing about these characters to know what is going on, I don't need to give more info about the Guardians because you don't need to know much about any of them, all I did in my comment was describe them as broken people and that's all the info you need. Whereas in Justice League, the same can't be said. Let me help you understand why rushing this movie out was their biggest mistake. Imagine, that the first Avengers was released in 2011, with Ironman being released in 2008, Ironman 2 in 2010 where it introduces present day Cap and Hawkeye, Black Widow, or Thor, and Cap 1 gets released in 2011 as well, and that's all that was done to setup the Avengers. Done, assuming that Black Widow was the one to get introduced along with Cap in Ironman 2, then the Avengers would have had to setup Hawkeye, Thor, Hulk, and Loki, they would have had to set up the motives, the confilcts, and the climax all in the span of 2 hours. The end result would be what JL basically is, a mess

"Jesse Collins The Guardians' backstories were a lot easier to setup than the Justice League (stories that are much more basic I'd say). Plus the Guardians' were, generally speaking, widely obscure when in comparison to... the Justice League for example. 

Guardians of the Galaxy
- Starlord: A space outlaw from earth who was kidnapped by aliens after his mother's death

- Groot and Rocket: Bounty hunters that were the result of genetic experimentation 

- Gamora: Raised as the daughter of the biggest tyrant in all of the galaxies, despises him and awaits a chance to kill him

- Drax: A man who was broken by the loss of his daughter and wife, and thus dedicated his life to getting revenge on the tyrant that took their lives

Now let's compare these to the Justice League 

Justice League

I'd go on, but honestly I'm tired of writing and you get the point, a lot of these characters have plenty to explore about them, something that DC should have done",0.7935,501
"Just saw this movie I was really hoping it'd be at least good but for me it was just as you said ""disposable"". The minimum I want from any superhero comic book movie is entertainment in the from of great action, decent plot, decent adversary and good character interactions that embody the iconic spirit of the source material. This movie failed to adequately meet these requirements.

In terms of Action laughable CGI and green screen work weighed down the already average action scenes as a matter of fact almost everything about the way this movie looked was distracting to me, scenes that featured Superman were too short to thoroughly enjoy and the some other members of the league felt kinda underwhelming but overall it still gets a pass.

In terms of plot conceptually it was fine I mean it was a Justice league formation story that featured Stephen wolf as the antagonist right? Nah it was the return of Superman or was it a rushed introduction to some of the members of the JL? Regardless one can still make sense of it all so it gets a pass.

In terms of central antagonist Stephen wolf's portrayal and appearance was horrible there is not a single redeeming quality about him other than the fact that he makes an alright punching bag.

Some good character dynamics were present but it was definitely not enough to carry the movie.

Personal problem for me but I'm not convinced by the characterization of Batman in these movies don't get me wrong Ben Affleck plays a decent Batman but the Batman character just has not really been realized mainly because he seems kinda stupid ,impulsive and expendable contrary to the ""world's greatest detective"", master strategist, master combatant and just a level headed leader featured in the comics. Anyway this movie lands in between a strong 6 or a weak 7 out of 10 for me.",0.9742,340

"Luigi Nastro People are just hopping on the hate bandwagon, I'd say it beat the first Avengers for me (I hated Avengers 1 so it wasn't really that high a bar for it to break) but visuals were amazing cause this is Zack Snyder, chemistry between the team was good, and the acting was great. Wonder Woman was great, for where they were trying to go with him, Aquaman was great, Cyborg was decent, Superman was what Superman would and should be, and Flash was the best thing to come out of this movie. But Batman is where it starts to go downhill for me, he felt bland in this movie when in comparison to BvS, also his unnecessary wit, it's not unlike Batman to throw a witty comment once in a while, for instance his line ""I didn't bring a sword"" felt like something that would come out of Batman's mouth, but to follow up not 2 minutes later with ""Jesus, he is tall""  just made it feel out of place and out of character, not to mention his awkward conversations with his teammates and the occasional pauses within them, try imagining the Batman from the JLA cartoon having some of these conversations, it wouldn't feel right. Superman fighting the league because he was ""confused"" just felt like lazy writing, also him recognizing Bruce but not Diana was bullshit, he met them both for the first time only hours apart. And of course, the movie was rushed, it would've been a much better idea to set up each individual character before bringing them all together, but it is quite apparent that DC are playing catch up with Marvel, and the fact that Thor: Ragnarok made more than JL better be enough of a warning for them to start doing better, because if not, they might not keep up",0.9941,347

All these other hero’s in gotg were from different worlds with life stories more detailed then you put. And they had three movies before Justice league to set up some of these hero’s. The problem wasn’t, is my point, that they threw them all in together without setting them up. The problem was he movie just isn’t that great. I really had fun watching it too, but gotg is more well done movie and not because the hero’s are so significantly less complicated. Because you could easily leave out details from your Justin league list and add more to the gotg list. And I don’t think what you left out from gotg was less significant than what you added for Justice league. But I appreciate the response for sure. Lots of detail lol",0.9824,176

"Rogue One was a really good movie with good story telling. Justice League on the other hand is a very clunky movie that was obviously rushed. Too many cliche'. Too many forced dramatic confrontations and bad dialogues which was hampered with rushed expositions/explanations. If you think about it, plot wise it could have worked. However because they rushed the movie and because they wanted to cram everything into this movie instead of doing what Marvel did (which introduced all the members with separate movies), Justice League just came out sloppy and half thought. It's not a horrible movie, but by any standards it wasn't as good as Rouge One. DC is not hopeless though. They should just get a new director and stop trying to catch up with Marvel.",0.9515,146

The truth is alot of people going to See these super hero movies don't know what marvel or DC is and that should be explained in depth.

"Snyder could do so much better, but his story order and build up needs work.

[Obviously don't read If you haven't watched it yet..although you're probably here because you did right?..right?]
Read at your own risk, seriously.



At the beginning of the movie with the clip of superman, they could've transitioned into the funeral instead of getting straight into batman's tangle with a parademon, and the reveal for the 4 members of the justice league (excluding superman..at least for now) could've been done way later into the movie after bruce (which is shown..) contemplates on how to solve the parademon crisis, THEN you recruit, THEN you start getting into the bits.
The whole ""building the alliance"" part could've been near half way in after seeing the imminent threat that's darkseid's army.
Snyder's biggest problem was how the movie was put together, It could've worked as a whole if not for the ""early"" reveals, and there being virtually no build up and an adundance of action..which makes me think they're trying too hard to be like marvel.
Wonder Woman actually wasn't half bad, it had decent build up, story organization, and you would've never believed that Snyder was on the team to begin with..albeit, Justice League's problem was probably placing him as ""lead"".

If you start piecing together the movie a different way (hopefully done in the director's cut) there's a solid build up, foundation, and lead into the final battle versus what the final product was.",-0.7181,294

"So, I just watched Justice League - ages after everyone else did. Anyways. I thought it was not as bad as some people say it was...but it's not that memorable either. But darn fans, really. Half (?) of you want a brooding Batman setting. And you have the other half saying they are fed up with brooding, you want humor. Dude, there's no pleasing you!

Speaking of, I can dig a fun joke-cracking Batman myself (though it does feel like I'm watching Ironman at times)... so long as you keep the detective part. And by this I mean have him have one cool-resourceful-guy-when-it-counts scene. But, anyways, I can accept the change. 
I even like Batman making mistakes - in fact I'd rather NOT realize this was an alien invasion right from the start to have a bit more built-up to it... damn it. Speaking of built-up, talking about Darkseid in the middle of the movie?! Way to ruin the big reveal! And not even use it!

Personally, I didn't dislike any of the character, as much as I disliked the lack of focus. What's the movie about? At first it seems to be about the sorry state of the world today, and feeling bad about the death of Superman/heroes... and then, aliens. 

I know how the team-up comes to be in the comic, but I would have rather it be the development of each of this characters' stories that drove the plot forwards, and how they worked together, to compensate for the lack of Superman... than the big end-of-the-world plot that feels a tad too premature (... and would inevitably be compared to the Avengers movie.)",0.5693,325
