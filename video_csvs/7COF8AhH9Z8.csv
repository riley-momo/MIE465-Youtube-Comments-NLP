I can grow my own food in my backyard as well. I just can not do it as efficently as professional farmers and will probably starve myself.

https://www.usaid.gov/zimbabwe/agriculture-and-food-security

Zimbabwe clearly has problems feeding itself. The government has failed and is at fault.

You can think the entire planet is in some white conspiracy all you want. It will not change that the people of Zimbabwe suffer because of the government.

I agree Africans should have been the greater food producers of the nation, but taking the land from the wealthy white guys whom have the money to invest in modern agriculture and the education on advanced farming was a disaster for Zimbabwe.

You demonstrate little concern for the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe as long as it fullfills some misguided belief of social justice.",-0.6858,147

Half of Zimbabwe faces hunger

But it is in Southern Africa that the drought's grip is fiercest, and Zimbabwe has been among the countries hardest hit. Although Zimbabwe is a food-exporting country in good years, the upcoming maize harvest is expected to be just 23 per cent of the 1999-2000 season. Over 6 million people -- almost half the population -- are expected to require food aid by the end of the year. The government's widely criticized plan to redistribute commercial, white-owned farms to landless Africans has contributed to the shortfall, but the FAO found that the failure of the rains during the January-March growing season was the principal cause.""

Maybe those who are dancing in the streets should try and go to the UK, Australia, Europe and the US and try to be given the same welcome non-Africans get in these regions then they would realise how good it was to have a leader like Mugabe that didn't bow to the zionists... The QAfricans were responsible for selling their own to the Arabs who then sold them to slavery in the west and now they are still selling their own and dance in the streets to be still without 10 years from now. Kenya was a in a very stable state until recently when they zionists interfered and set disharmony among the people with the help of the weak and selfish traitors among them... Nigeria despite its vast wealth in natural resources is reduced to a third world status... When are the Africans going to come to the realisation that they are kept down by a force that is not in their best interest??
