"Regular kids are too dumb to know the difference between imaginary and realistic, mostly between the ages of 4-9, Although overtime in human intelligence decreased for most, and increased for some. I figured it out myself when I was about 8. It was very simple actually. First, at Christmas parties, nobody would would talk about Santa, know that I was 8 and my mom took me to a Christmas party. Also flying reindeers are impossible, Santa would not have about 10 x the amount of presents (Human Population), I for one one do not have a chimney in my childhood home, and if he was real then the Military would of thought it was a terriost plane on the radar, and shoot it down so they think it can't bomb anybody. And if you really think Santa had an ""Anti-Radar"" Radar system, then you are incorect, because we have eyes on every single thing everybody in the whole world can think of. And also we have the technology to track different speeds in the United States itself. And there are also literally another 2 million reasons. Therefore, Santa, is, not, real.",0.8627,220
