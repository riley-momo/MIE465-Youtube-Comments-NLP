"wow, so someone who actually wants to wait for a committed real love based relationship to form -  before having sex is... so funny....  ok good Kate,  and people who think like kate... your way,  to have a full on sexual relation ship after the 3rd or 4th date - here's what that has brought us the last 50 years:  1) sky rocketing rate of increase of STD's among teens and 20 somethings (before the 60's sexual revolution in that age group,  std's were non existent,  now it is increasing rapidly  2)  very high divorce rate when you form relationships by putting the cart before the horse everything is out of order and the relationship is built on a weak foundation - divorce rates have never been higher  3)  the popular current idea that sex is basically just a form of recreation to be defined which ever way / any way you want, with many changing partners -   this has lead to literally Record numbers of young women (and men) in need of psychiatry and counselling to deal with their anxiety and self esteem problems from these unhealthy loose relationships and the after effects.  -->    People -  listen -  we are made and designed for committed love relationships -   that is the only way sexuality can be healthy for mind body and soul -   and when people try to go against that,  be loose and play the field -  it only leads to depression and insecurity  -   when will you learn ??",0.9274,273
