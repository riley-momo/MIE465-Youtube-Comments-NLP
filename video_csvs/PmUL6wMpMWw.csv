I’m so annoyed that you didn’t pay anyone that courtesy, particularly if they’re paying you to watch it! Lastly, if you’re in Australia as a parent, DO NOT take your teenage child to see this film thinking it’s some dark “black widow” political/spy film. You will be sorely mistaken. The idea that my 15 year old sister could see this with her friends makes me feel sick. Not an overall bad movie, just disgusted at the Australian rating.
