"THIS IS THE ULTIMATE STAR WARS SPOILER! HOW THE WHOLE EPIC MOVIE SERIES WILL END!--- At the end of Episode IX the droids will get separated from their friends and have to climb into yet another lifepod like the one that took them to Tatooine so many years before. But instead of landing on a nearby planet, they will be sucked into a transgalactic wormhole that will send them to the Milky Way galaxy where they crash land on Earth during the reign of the Egyptian pharaohs. Centuries later, at the end of his career in archaeology, Indiana Jones will discover the droids and reactivate them. They will tell him the entire tale of the Skywalker family, the rise and fall of the Empire, and the resurrection of the Republic. Unfortunately for Jones and the droids, government agents will arrive and secret them away, erasing all evidence of their existence, EXCEPT for Dr. Jones' notes about the incredible epic story they told him. These notes will get lost and found, passed from person to person, until they end up in the hands of a young film maker in the 1970s, one George Lucas, who will be inspired to turn the story into the movie Star Wars....",-0.7592,231
