"My favorite song on the album.  I have been anxiously waiting for the video. I would have never imagined this video with this song but it's PERFECT! I was literally in tears watching it. The song has an entirely new meaning to me now. The love & bond of friendship is just as strong & powerful as the romantic bond. This was powerful to say the least. Kip Moore, chances are you will never see this, but you sir, are amazing. A true talent. As real as they come. Each of your songs touch a part of my soul that make me feel things that I don't even want to feel at times. You seem so down to earth & real. You seem like someone I'd just want to hang out with at a bonfire & have a beer with. Someone you could call when you really needed someone to talk to. I think that's why so many of us are drawn to you. You feel like you are one of our friends. Please don't stop doing what you do. Please don't stop writing. Please don't ever stop being you. We love you. Exactly as you are. Thank you for sharing your beautiful music with us. You are hands down my favorite artists. You are badass!",0.9984,243
