It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life. He desires first place - not second and in doing so NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly desires you to come to that realization dear one. He truly does. This is your starting point with our loving Creator that will last for all eternity. May God bless you in the MIGHTY name of Jesus Christ our Savior. ❤️❤️❤️,0.9835,148

"For all you triggered, snowflake cucks in need of a safe space because a movie stars women and why the team is composed of all women. Not everything is some Illuminati, deep state, underground conspiracy against men. You triggered cucks are seriously compensating for something to be so angered by women.

Here's an explanation from the director/writer Alex Garland.

“What I loved about the book, which I thought was a good way to approach it, was that these are fully capable scientists who just happen to be women,” Garland said, noting the film is not focused on the kind of gender politics that made up the heart of “Ex Machina.” “It’s not like a badge of honor. We’re not waving a flag. They are women, that’s just the way it is. That seemed like the best way to approach it for me. Otherwise it can all seem virtue-seeming, and it’s not that at all. Hopefully it’s just a strange and interesting story with a strange and interesting group of characters.”

And an explanation from the book.

According to the book, this choice is made because The Southern Reach organization experiments with different combinations of people for its exploration teams in hopes of increasing their chance of success. For example, the 11th mission was entirely comprised of men and other missions mixed the sexes equally or had different distributions of them.",0.965,273
"For anyone that served knows exactly how women are in field roles. 
That's why they can never pass any advance training for rangers, green 
berets, seals, and etc...
Before the MUH Sexism comment's begin, I make specific mention of 
""advance training"" due to the facts PT standards had to be lowered just 
for women to pass boot camp.
It's well known fact, the only reason why we see women in the service 
because of lowered standards women are able to achieve, just so they can
 be the service.
 So that's why when hollywood pushes this fantasy ""Female Badass"" and 
roles ""women never normal occupy"", it creates this very push back you 
see in the comments. That and the constant new shows that portray men as idiots and white males as terrible people.",-0.3612,151

Don’t even bother mentioning Jamie as he couldn’t do shit back then after losing his hand. Jon is simply being smart. He has to stop the white walkers, he can’t do that unless the Queen with the dragons is happy. I’m almost certain Dany will die before the end of the show. Lady Tyrell is dead as dicks. And Cersei is in charge because like I said, the rest of her family is dead. Women have ruled alone in history, why does it bother you so much in fantasy?

sanity So a featurette isn't a movie? And this isn't a trailer?? Your retort put me sleep Sweetheart.,0.7041,22
sanity Thanks so much for explaining Fuck all. Feminism is Cancer. You are a western woman which means you are the most priveliged group on Planet Earth. No one watches these female action movies. No one.,-0.8555,41
"sanity The reason it looks like shit is because  it looks like shit. Also, Natalie Portman (feminist) and a bunch of chicks acting like violent men with guns is not great cinema. It's pretty much the equivalent of Fast and Furious except less believable. Same for Ghostbusters(Feminists)and any number of Scarlett Johanssen (Feminist) action films. Girls doing tough guy roles is just dumb. Do women really want to watch women acting out all the male behavior they supposedly hate?",-0.9433,94

yeah a book that is bullshit too! Written by a soyboy Feminist with an agenda! Even if all women could do what men are capable of doing in combat does not mean they should! Women were not made for that!,-0.5526,44
