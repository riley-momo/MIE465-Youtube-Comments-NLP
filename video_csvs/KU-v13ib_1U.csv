"Dear Friends Jesus Christ has a perfect plan for your life. NEVER FORGET THAT! But it is up to you to let Him work in your life. He won't force you. He must always be invited. It requires an ACTIVE pursuit to have a personal relationship with Him. God (through Jesus Christ) desires your active pursuit of Him more than anything else in your life, and in doing so NO ONE to Him is more desirable than YOU! He so eagerly wants you to come to that realization dear one. He truly does. This is your starting point with our loving Creator that will last for all eternity.

So friends, The Lord loves you, truly. 

Jesus also promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so come to Him today! 

All you need is faith as a mustard seed, and words from the heart. He will hear you when you call upon Him, and He will save you when you do! Hallelujah!
