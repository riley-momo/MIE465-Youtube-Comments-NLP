The Shape of Oscars.,0.0,5
"The Shape of Water is like a Rorschach test. 
1. Romantics see it as a unique love story that also is an ode to 30’s-60’s cinema in style and filming technique  
2.  Literary and visual arts folks see a cornucopia of symbolism and color analysis that will keep film students busy for a couple of generations 
3. Fans of del Toro's talent see a master director who can create and then tell a strangely bizarre story while bringing very talented actors and crew to even greater heights than anyone thought possible
4. Those in the political center or center-right or center-left may see it as call for repudiation of haters on all edges of the political spectrum (and I am a white/hetero male on the center-right)
5. Those who come straight from alt-right and illuminati sites see a ""beastiality"" film - but miss realizing (*spoilers) two central characters are a male sentient god-like 'creature' and a female who actually is a 'fish out of water.'
6. Those who find it boring may prefer Transformers or other CGI-heavy flicks
7. Dudes and gals who grew up loving classic and B movie horror see an homage to creature feature films
8.  Movie producers see a profitable film with a budget of under $20mil, with production value that appears to exceed $130mil - which is its worldwide ticket sales to date
9.  As someone who saw about 4 dozen films in 2017, and has been predicting Oscar winners for years, I see this best pic of 2018 as arguably the best of the Oscar BP winners over the past five years",0.9879,303
