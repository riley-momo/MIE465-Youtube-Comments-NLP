Sorry there's a lot of shit going on in this world that the news refuses to report and its no conspiracy theory.  The true bad people of the world are the funders of mainstream so they get whatever they wanna nix out of print.  I'm quite irritated with the whole situation.  I'm not saying trump is amazing. I'm saying no one wants to hear the truth.  Antifa is destroying property. They report that kinda but no one cares. Terrorism is legal in our country.  There's a pedophile ring being ran out of Washington DC. Trump may even be part of it.  Its also infecting Hollywood and msm.  I no longer can enjoy my TV shows because actors are idiots... and some of them need federal prison.  Madonna ....Kathy griffin...   Chelsea handler...  and they aren't even the pedophiles.  If you just read john podestas emails.... you may start to understand why I am so adamant about it.  If you don't know who he is then you really don't know who Hillary is.  I'm sorry for getting so upset.  But this worlds about to change vastly and its looking like not good at all.  If you decide you will read his emails then I'll send you a link to a documentary about an innocent man who served federal prison time  under Obama.  I want a woman president. And a nigger.  And if Islam was actually peaceful....another Muslim president too.  Money is important but it doesnt top honesty and coming together.  And its soon going to be worthless.  Also if you are reading some of that stuff... look up Dearborn Michigan muslims on youtube.  Its now completely under sharian law. Along with a large part of Michigan.  I don't reccomend ever ever going there.  Its where henry ford museum is. I'm sure you send once.  Or search... what's wrong in Michigan.  I don't want to be enemies.  I like being friends.  I spend 24 hours practically a day watching news.  Not all ALEX JONES LOL,-0.9813,374

"The Rock is the nicest guy out there. No doubt about that. He is my childhood hero. But I really can't get over the fact that people call him 'the biggest movie star'. What makes him the biggest? His movies are mostly action based and do turn in profit for the studios, which is not overwhelming, as there are so many others like him. Most of the times I watch his movies thinking most of the run time ""what's for lunch?"" I believe the best of him is yet to come. I really wish him all the best for the future.",0.9662,116
