"Families show affection in different ways, I get that. I think kissing in general is weird, but my family was never very physical growing up. But the fact he was forced to kiss him in order to check his fantasy football is weird as fuck. And he makes him do it again because he wasn't satisfied with the first one he got....way too long...

And he never even asks directly for a kiss, so this clearly happens a lot, as the kid knew exactly what he wanted.  I dunno....I felt kinda gross looking at this.",-0.6158,109

Peck kiss to a 5/6/7 year old Son .. Ok. But a 10 year old long kiss? Which the son clearly wasn’t comfortable with like Will Smith’s kid is simply inappropriate.

What is wrong with this lady, this is unacceptable PERIOD, not because he is the dad because I too believe that even the mom should never kiss her child on the lips after a certain age, after a certain age the child must bathe alone and sleep alone as well.

His son is obviously too old for this, did not want to do it, and was disgusted himself afterward when he wiped his mouth. Looks familiar!
