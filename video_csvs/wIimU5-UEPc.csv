Everyone stop bullying her. She’s been through hell and has had and is going through medical issues and depressions and having low lives and paparazzi harass her at all times only makes it worse. Let her be a human. She isn’t hurting anyone and she’s a beautiful soul.,-0.9643,58

"I think it has something to do with the earlier in life you learn the lyrics. Selena remembered all of the lyrics to Barney, but her later stuff she remembers less.
