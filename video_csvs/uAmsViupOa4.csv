In testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last June, Comey said he had spoken to senior colleagues including Bowdich about President Donald Trump’s allegedly asking Comey to have the FBI back off its probe into Michael Flynn.
Because of that apparent conversation, and because he was the No. 3 official under Comey, Bowdich is a potential witness into whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey.",0.5994,122

They are doing great things for this country and this country is doing great things for them by granting them this oportunity to become someone in life, so why deport them? Because they are making more progress than you and your ignorant remarks? Open your eyes don't be blind think deeply see past your ignorance i know you can do it. Trump is a business man and he knows if he keeps the dreamers that would earn this country alot more money even just by the applications (560$ each) than other wise deporting them which would cost the government alot of money and the precious wall wouldn't be able to happen. If you think about it, keeping the dreamers is also gonna help with the wall funding so it doesn't have to come out straight from our paychecks (which is what is planned so far) Trump is a business man and he sees this oportunity, so if you love trump so much (I can tell ur one of his supporters by your ignorance) atleast try to use your common sense and reason  or get a higher education so you can stop being a blind sheep and see what really is going on",0.9891,300

With the help of the greedy traitorous pig Zuckerberg, the self proclaimed ""Citizen of the World!"" Understand that he took psychology (to understand how the human mind worked) & computer science courses, dropping out of Harvard to create his endorphin and dopamine FAKEBOOK, to work the peasants of the world! And now he is in China, bowing down to their dictatorship, controlling their social media, turning over all of their information to screw more of the peasants, for money. This traitorous Drumpf is not only selling his products, but is just another worthless 1%er, the true enemy. Evil is as evil does... Now nothing is going to change, until the time of the gentiles is fulfilled. Always remember the Word, “All have turned away, they have together become worthless; there is no one who does good, not even one."" This perverse corrupt man-made system will continue until the end, no matter what Mueller finds. This traitorous republican congress are laughing as they divide this country to steal everything they can from, ""We The People."" Understand that even if drumpf were removed, you'll still have the religious fanatic Pence who will complete the job! But sadly it will never be enough for these pigs; they want it all! So this traitor drumpf, along with his traitorous congress will make sure by the end of 2018 we'll be at war; so you won't have to worry about the 2018 elections. Countless human livestock will be going off to China, I mean North Korea. As China is working to destroy the US Petrodollar, offering their Yuan. Remember Saddam, when he tried to screw with our Petrodollar! The funny thing is that China is backing their dollar with Gold, our gold that is! Still we'll be able to reduce the excessive Asian human livestock by billions. Plus, thanks to bone spurs none of the 1%ers' little piggies will have to be sacrificed, just the peasants. Sadly nothing is going to change! If you want to come out of your box, watch these videos and understand.
