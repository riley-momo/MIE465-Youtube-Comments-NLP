"$400-500 for a phone with a low-tier CPU? No, thanks. Zenfones were very competitive in 1st and 2nd gen (I was extremely happy in my first year of original Zenfone 5 use). Then ASUS bloated the software, then they jacked the prices for new models. The only Zenfones that are still a good deal are the most basic models, like Zenfone GO, if you don't need much power in your phone. But then you can add like $30 and get Xiaomi Mi A1.",0.947,97

True price is a factor. Yet how you review it it’s like a  ‘oh the way this is a amazing phone’ but don’t focus on that. Look at the price.
