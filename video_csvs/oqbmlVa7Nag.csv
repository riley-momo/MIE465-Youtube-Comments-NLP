They put in charge a former Japanese colonialist to rule over south korea and during the course of his regime he committed countless massacres. South Korea literally has some of the highest suicide rates in the world, thats how western imposed capitalism is faring for them. While the self sufficient North Koreans have been able to endure the destruction of their entire country and killing of 20 percent of their population to rebuild a beautiful nation able to stand up to american hegemony. Main reason US doesnt like NK besides them being communist? Well its their nuclear weapons, and why you my ask does the DPRK need nuclear weapons?

Quick quote of just one of such massacres “The Geochang massacre (Korean: 거창 양민학살 사건,[3][4] Hanja: 居昌良民虐殺事件) was a massacre conducted by the third battalion of the 9th regiment of the 11th Division of the South Korean Army between 9 February 1951 and 11 February 1951 of 719 unarmed citizens in Geochang, South Gyeongsang district of South Korea.[1][5][6] The victims included 385 children.[1] The 11th Division also conducted the Sancheong-Hamyang massacre two days earlier. The general commanding the division was Choe Deok-sin.[7]",0.3384,141

Also if you would like an additional source to expand your mind on the subject try watching the Propaganda Game on netflix, its a whole documentary inside north korea that debunks many of the fabricated lies about the nation.",-0.6124,115
"M those ‘refugees’ are paid by the South Korean Government to embellish their stories, and yet most of them take their story back years later, and in fact more people return to north korea than leave it. Not convinced? I dont blame you, decades of anti communist propaganda has an effect on most minds, but i will give you a famous example you can look up yourself. Her name is Park Yeon mi, she made a very popular and emotional but inconsistent story about north korea and made a living from cashing in from telling her stories. Look her up and just see how emotional she makes it, and yet it is all fake. 

Not convinced yet? Well if your mind isnt closed yet you can even check out this guardian article talking about how inconsistent most North Korean Defectors stories are.
