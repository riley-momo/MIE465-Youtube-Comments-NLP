Yolanda M. Reyes I grew up in other cold places my whole life lol I only lived in the south for 5 years.  I do a lot for this city as it does for me--its my city too. But now you've  proved my point that most non-Minnesotans  (like Cardi in this clip) aren't accustomed to this weather. Not sure why people think this is what drugs look like. And I'm a recovering addict 100%. This isn't drugs.  This is a tight dress in cold ass weather.,0.4767,97
