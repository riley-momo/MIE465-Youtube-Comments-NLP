With an increase in people being transgender, it's good to know the skeletal structure of a man and woman. You can not change the bones you can only change muscles and fat.

 Women have a curved back so that they can carry a baby, whilst a man has a straight back. Women have hips that start below their crotch resulting in a ""Q angle"", so they can give birth to a baby, whilst men's hips start above the crotch line. 

Here is a good document created by a youtuber called tricksofthestrade on the skeletal structure.

"For all you saying cap could beat bp. Bp can lift 2 tons above his head while cap can only lift 1,200 pounds, so bp is stonger. Bp has Antarctic Vibranium(A.K.A Anti-Metal) Claws so he can cut through Caps shield. He also knows every single fighting style, has the advantage of Superpowers such as different ways to see such as infrared, increased agility, the power to raise the dead(which is a cool one i might add). He is also very smart he went to most colleges. His strongest feat is that he beat logos with his tiger god ability",0.8777,118

"one of the problems with the black panther movie is that one of the best characters is now dead.
So how come he was so vulnerable, or will he come back to life in a later movie some  how, he had the so-called power to rejuvenate right as he took the weed.

I thought that was the point of the weed it made them have super powers of healing and so on.

If not then what's the point of the weed?

Then a question who is stronger black panther or captain America, they say Black panther, but hold on captain America gets hurt and heals himself rapidly, black panther simply dies, that's what happened to the other Panther in the other suit.

He simply died, which made no sense if he had those special powers to heal himself the wounds would have simply healed themselves no matter how bad, that's what happens to cpt America.

I found Black Panther a bit of a disappointment due to the inconsistencies within the story, also the racial slurs were a bit off putting.

Other than that it was a good movie, but it is supposed to be fantasy not a racial awareness film.",-0.9527,218
