"Unrelated to this fantastic song/video, but I'm not sure where else to ask: what do you think JBJ's MBTI types are? I've been re-watching Just Be Joyful JBJ, and I'm thinking something like this:
Taehyun = ENFJ or ESFJ
Kenta = ESFP
Sanggyun = ESTP
Yongguk = INTJ
Hyunbin = ISTP
Donghan = INFJ

The one I am most doubtful about is Hyunbin, he's so weird XD What do you think? Also, if there is a better place to discuss this, please share :D",0.9787,95
