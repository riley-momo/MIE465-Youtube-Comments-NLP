"This shell was actually made by Jim Widman who was hired by Phil Grucci. He made an extra large WASP (Widman automatic shell pasting) machine specially for this event. It is shown in some of the shots. They give him no credit but do show him in a couple of the video shots. One hell of a shell builder and really nice guy.
     By the way jackey tran, that was not a failed shell but was a circle of comets launched around the 56"" shell when it lifted (fired). Shells do look similar to that when they fail on the ground but this was not the case.
     Also I see someone mentioned that it was a crap effect for the size. You must realize to make a very large shell for the first time a builder does not have the luxury of ""tuning"" it by making many of them and adjusting the burst composition, the shell casing thickness (too thin and the shell effect is weak, too thick and everything in the shell blows up before the shell opens called a detonation) among other critical construction aspects. This is a fine art not a science hence like Frank Zappa said ""There's always a chance somthin might fuck up""
By the way, Steven Farruga lots of my peeps have been to Malta for the Feast of the Assumption and have worked with some of the band clubs. They make cylinder shells in Malta not ball shells so that statement means nothing. But we do love 
Maltese fireworks and that is the style the group makes most of the time. Large multi-breaks with lots of noise.",-0.9085,302
