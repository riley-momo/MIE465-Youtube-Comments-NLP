"That is the truth of the matter, Youtube has not been around long and who knows how long it can sustain. After he is gone who will replace him as we only watch because of him because any thousand people can review the same thing but he stands out more and after he is gone who will take over and who can promise the same success? Like angry grandad, after he passed away the channel has never really been the same, after a certain point, who knows how long this will last.",0.8793,99

(But these are all the obvious tech toys that many of us research and know a lot about already) But...besides that you present new tech in other avenues of ones life..flashlights...shoes...batteries....wallets...etc etc. This channel upgrades and educates me about all the tech in my life...which in turn makes life better. Thank you! I found a new wallet, water bottle, and mouse all through your channel...and it's upgraded my life by making tasks easier and killing stress.  Again thank you!  😊.",0.9729,181
