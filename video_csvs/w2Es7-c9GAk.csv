"I don't understand her. I've never been a fan because she's not a good musician. There's multiple video evidences of her out of breath from barely moving and unable to hit certain notes live. You all say ""it's her lupus, it's hard for her to catch her breath."" She gets surgery, her lupus is gone, arthritis is gone, energy, blood pressure and everything is better, but months later she performs at the amas and she still can't sing well. I'm tired of the excuses. I get it, she has an acoustic alto voice, but this song was well within her range. She must have mad nerves before going live, that's what chamomile tea, calming herb supplements, deep breaths, or even a shot of alcohol is for! And she's done a hundred live performances so you'd think she'd get a little better. But at this point I have no idea what the heck is the deal.",-0.8324,179

She really wasn't in the right state at this award show and whatever is bugging her I hope she overcomes it. People need to understand she is a human being, lots of people say it but forget it, no body has any idea what she is going through and I don't care if she was performing at the AMA's and she lip-synced, she still tried to put on a emotional performance regardless and I suggest people at least respect or acknowledge that. She has talent and maybe that night was just not the right time for her. Just try and be nice and don't act like she is obligated to do this and that just because she has something  or acts a certain way. Everyone has there own issues regardless of how small it may be and they all have there own ways of coping and there is no time frame for it. ✌

"I will never understand why Selena is so massively successful with so many hits and followers. She literally has no style, no individual look or sound to call her own. She flits from style to style in music and fashion and doesn't seem to have a clue who she wants to be. And if you're going to lip sync, which in my book is a cardinal sin, you damn well better be an amazing performer or dancer, which clearly she is not. That performance was painful to watch. I was actually concerned for her well-being because she looked confused, like she just wandered out of bed in that nightgown, into the street, and wound up on the stage. My criticisms are purely of her musical ability, not personal - I really hope she's ok and I know she's been through a lot this year. The thing is, ever since Come and Get It, I've always scratched my head with regard to her success when she's so weak-voiced and generic, without any consistent style.",0.7975,192

"I'm sorry but why does she still try to have a singing career, she doesn't sing! Her fans are ridiculous yes she had surgery but that was MONTHS ago and she's been doing harder activities than this since then. Yet whenever she does a bad performance (which is 99% of the time) her fans always say she's sick, god sake grow up so according to you lot she's sick 24/7? Most singers perform better than her when they're sick, if she was sick and did have a panic attack before hand then she shouldn't of performed, like Rihanna was sick before her Grammy performance so she pulled out. She has NO excuse for lip syncing other than she knows she can't sing. She's literally only stayed famous because she's pretty and has a huge social media following. Pathetic. There's people with actual talent out their that deserve her recognition.",-0.9813,164
