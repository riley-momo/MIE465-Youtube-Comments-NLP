"Compare the joy and respect for their teammates and our flag and our National Anthem by these girls, compared to the overpriced thugs and ghetto trash in the NBA and NFL.  It's why I have not been to any male-dominated sport in over 25 years, whereas I'll go see any female sports at least once a month at nearby Liberty University.  I do feel badly for Team Canada, but they had regulation time to win it all, they had overtime to win it all, and they had the shootout to win it all- and didn't, so no need to be sulking about the loss or taking the 2nd place medals off.  I fault the coach for that.  Only one team can win.  That's the nature of the sport.  Try losing with grace like what happened with this year's Daytona 500 where the leader with 1/2 lap to go was wrecked.  Aric showed lots of class and was applauded for it.",0.9809,175
Congrats US Women's hockey team!  Excellent game and shoot out.  I love Amanda Kessel's move and shot.....wow.  Canada does not have to hand their head low.  It was about 2 powerful and talented teams fighting to the end.,0.8769,45

"Dear friends you may feel lonely and lost in this big world, but just know you are NEVER alone. Jesus Christ always have been and will always be with you on this earth. He is all around you, hovering over you even as you seek Him. He is nearer than you dare believe, closer than the air you breathe. If His children could only recognize His presence, they would never feel lonely again. Jesus knows every thought before you think it, every word before you speak it. His presence impinges on your innermost being. Can you see the absurdity of trying to hide anything from Him? You can easily deceive other people, and even yourself; but our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, whom loves you so much, can read you like an open book, large print.                                                                                                          

Deep within themselves, most people have some awareness of Jesus imminent presence. Many people run from Him and vehemently deny His existence, because the closeness of Jesus terrifies them. But His own children have nothing to fear, for Jesus Christ have cleansed them by His blood and clothed them in His righteousness. Be blessed by His intimate nearness. Since Jesus lives in you, let Him also live through you, shining LIGHT into darkness. Become one with Christ by telling Him you will give you life to Him this very moment. Repent and as Him to forgive you of your sins. Believe in Him, have Faith in Him and allow Him to lead and guide you in EVERY aspect of your life. Jesus Christ's love for you can't be measured or described using mere words. It is deep, eternal, and special just for you. ❤️❤️❤️ (Psalm 139:1-4;  Ephesians 2:13;  2 Corinthians 5:21)",0.9417,334

"If women want to be just as equal to men right on the line does that mean when they piss me off or hit me first I can hit them just like a man? If not tell me why? Because it seems women only want to be equal when it comes to the fun stuff- Such as ""Sports,"" ""Wages,"" and ""Air Plain Pilots,"" But when it comes to, ""War,"" ""Prison,"" ""Hard Labor,"" and, ""Cole Minning,"" they want nothing to do with it- And if they do it is very few- More women are on this planet and not because they are born more- Do you realize there are 400,000 more boys born per year than women- So how in the hell can this be? I will tell you why- Men are bullet catchers, and they die in hard labor jobs every year- If you want to be equal stop picking and choosing what you want- This is not a buffet",-0.8146,195
