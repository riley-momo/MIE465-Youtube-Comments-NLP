Not the wedding nor pregnancy which is sad bc they easily could make two more fifty shades movies and showing us a lot more in details. #hardcorefan",-0.8057,95

"❤ L’esibizione di Liam Payne per la Regina Elisabetta: lunedì 12 marzo si è tenuto nell’Abbazia di Westminster Abbey di Londra l’evento annuale Commonwealth Service. Il cantante è stato ospite dell’importante manifestazione inglese, che ogni anno celebra l’impegno eterno del Commonwealth: la cerimonia è accompagnata da eventi culturali, in compagnia di grandi ospiti. Quest’anno, la famiglia reale ha invitato anche Liam Payne, ad esibirsi nella prestigiosa Abbazia londinese ... 
Liam è attualmente al lavoro sul primo album in solitaria, che segnerà il suo debutto nel mercato discografico: sicuramente, l’album conterrà i singoli rilasciati negli ultimi mesi, da Strip That Down a Get Low, Bedroom Floor e For You, inciso con Rita Ora per la colonna sonora di Cinquanta Sfumature di Rosso. A breve, inoltre, verrà rilasciato un duetto con la superstar latina J Balvin! ... http://bit.ly/2Dpf8yw",0.1511,168
