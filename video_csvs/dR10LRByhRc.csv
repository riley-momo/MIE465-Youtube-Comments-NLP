"A note on your advertisement: I personally really appreciated the way you inserted it. You explained you obv needed to get paid in a relatable way, you were unapologetic, upfront, and succinct. And side note: Your content and other youtubers content keeps us entertained for free. If you need to do adverts to pay your bills/improve your content as you progress, we should have no problems with that if we want to keep watching. I guess this is a thought you already have had at some point, just wanted to let you know that it's valid from this end of the deal too. :)
