"Hats off to Coach Pederson. One thing I noticed he’s doing this year is he’s spreading the ball around, using the skills of many different players. This is why the eagles are scary good this year. Besides Carson, there isn’t any particular players that you can narrow in on and “remove”from the game. You take out Ajayi, we got Blount, clements, and Barner. You take out Ertz, we got Brent celek. You take out our entire d line, and we have another great d line right behind them. There is mad competition among all of our players, motivating them to play their best. Even if Wentz gets hurt, we have an experienced former eagles QB, nick foles right behind him. Good luck bill belichick, you’re going to have one heck of a time trying to beat us in the super bowl",0.9501,172

"Id like to see this game again if we got Dan Bailey, Tyron Smith, Sean Lee, and Ezekiel Elliot. We were missing our best kicker, i know eagles were too but we were missing lee, who is by far our best D-Man, zeke was gone, running was kinda weak that game, and missing Smith, the best offensive line-men, allowing plays like were Barnett swipe the ball from Dak in the fumble.",0.8438,83

Now it shows, if a player that is on the field can see it,in their eye's, he know.

Not all of the players quit, if you watch football a lot, you will know which players don't give a damn.",0.1695,82
