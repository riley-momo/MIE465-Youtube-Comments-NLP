"The U didn't always look like it does now. It used to look like V, and it was all the rage back in the day. W was created from putting the two U's that look like V's together.",-0.7864,42
"The Wynn was actually taken from an Anglo-Saxon rune of the same name, because there was not a Latin equivalent to a ""w"", eventually discarded because of its similarity to ""p"" and common desognation as ""uu"". If I'm not mistaken, for Anglo-Saxon sounds not represented by a Latin letter, yet still used in common dialect, they would either borrow a rune (e.g. ""þ"") or adapt Latin letters to represent a blended sound (e.g. ""æ"", ""œ""). 

Anyways, the backstory of that is the residents of the area we know today as the United Kingdom used a script with tall, thin glyphs called runes, but their alphabet and language became more Romanized when the Normans from present day France invaded in 1066. (Fun fact: they also witnessed Halley's comet that same year). This is why early modern and modern English is unique in that it is a beautiful blend of Greco-Romanesque and Proto-Germanic linguistic elements. That's also why you'll notice a lot of Spanish and Italian words are right in line but English is only around half the time in line; English words with Anglo-Saxon-developed letters like ""w"" and ""th"" also for this reason are not usually cognates to words from Romance languages or Latin.",0.9456,248
