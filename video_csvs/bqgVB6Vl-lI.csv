At the beginning of the video Jim says ""Hey,"" as he passes Dwight and Dwight  responds with a ""hello""
You wouldn't greet someone that you hate.

And in the middle of the video when Jim is hesitating on saying what day the next day is, Dwight finishes his sentence and says ""Saturday,"" 

You wouldn't assist people you hate.

This shows that they mutually tolerate each other but act like they hate each other.",-0.7637,103

"Jim is a horrible person. And before you say that ""it's not real hurr durr"", I am, shockingly, well aware that it's not real and I am criticizing that not for being a shitty real life situation, but precisely for being shitty sitcom writing. They gave Jim all those pranks but they forgot to give us a reason to hate Dwight, so all this just completely misses the point. I remember how satisfied I was when Jim pranked Andy and ultimately caused him to be sent to anger management, cause it was WELL DESERVED. Dwight does not really deserve any of this. Just think how much more satisfying it would be if Jim pranked Ryan on a regular basis instead.",0.2611,134
