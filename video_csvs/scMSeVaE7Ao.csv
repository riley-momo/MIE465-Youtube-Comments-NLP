"""All the NBA chin- fans in china"" is what I heard. It would be weird to say ""NBA chinks"", because that would be referring to Chinese basketball players.

It's unfortunate that those efforts may have gone to waste due to a misinterpreted sentence..

But aside from that..
Drummond getting blatantly cut off. Gasol trying really hard to speak Mandarin and then forced to do an English take (with embarrassed eye roll). Dinwiddie attempting Mandarin confused af (playing it cool). Then Rubio simultaneously wishing everyone a happy New Year and fearing for his life.

"Man I'm really disappointed in a lot of other people. First, even though JJ probably didn't mean to says it (hopefully not), people should know that ""ch*nk"" is not a word to be said around. There are plenty of people in the comments using that word and it makes me sad to know that people take it so lightly. Sure, ""it's just a word"" but it has a large background of racism behind it. Back in the day, when a whole lot of Americans (aka not all Americans but a large amount of them) were the definition of racists, those Americans thought that the Chinese people were taking all of their jobs (and people still think they are). In reality, most of them were escaping death from war and poverty. If they didn't come, they would pretty much be left out to die. Plus, if they did get hired, they took the jobs that needed people asap (and there weren't enough people immediately in that area that were willing to do the job) and/or they were taking jobs that nobody else wanted to do (aka the lower waged ones that were sometimes very dangerous). Additionally, the ones that were really ""taking"" jobs were the machines being brought over from Europe or developed in America. They made almost everything more efficient, meaning that there were less people needed for a task. This is around the time that the racist people started calling the Chinese people ""ch*nks"". 
Furthermore, the racist people in America specifically banned Chinese immigration for over 10 years. This even caused even more hysteria against Chinese people, who were being forced out of their homes by racists. A lot of these Chinese people were burned alive, starved to death, and just outright murdered for being Chinese, even if they were born in the US (which makes them Americans). If you want to, there are a lot of propaganda against Chinese people from around this time period. You can google it to find out. Sure, this situation might not be as bad as what happened to other races, but that doesn't mean we should turn a blind eye to what happened. We shouldn't forget about what racist Americans did against the Chinese. If we did, it could happen again, to anyone. BTW, I'm glad that I was taught this at school (I'm an American btw), hopefully other people were too. The only thing was that I wasn't taught about the riots in this time period where Chinese people were murdered. They never told me there were casualties. Also, not hate against Americans, I'm one too. Just making sure that people understand the background behind things and that something like this doesn't happen again.
Secondly, yes, there are racist people everywhere. There was a Chinese company that did blackface but that doesn't reflect all of China. It's like saying that all white people are racist because a couple white people or a white person in high position said the n word. Believe me, the people who first acted against the blackface in China were Chinese people themselves. It's just that nobody hears about the Chinese people fighting against blackface because the negatives in countries are what brings in views (plus most people who aren't Chinese can't read/understand what in the Chinese news or Chinese social media). The point is that there are racist people everywhere, including China and the rest of the world.
