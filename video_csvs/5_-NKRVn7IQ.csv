My point is, over the year... Why can't you learn to pronounce GALAXY instead of GALUX... I mean come on, I'm from Indonesia, and it's not the end of the world to learn to pronounce it crystal-clear. My opinion might trivia, but it hurts my hearing artistically.",-0.1957,100

"Galaxy s9 camera is disappointing in real life. The hype created by showing the variable aperture on paper, doesn’t make much difference in practical. Pixel 2 is outstanding in camera department. Image processing is alot better in pixel2. Hdr in pixel 2 is amazing. Ofcourse samsung is the king in lowlight shots. Samsung needs to improve camera by software updates inorder to compete with the pixel 2. 
The one who wants the phone only for camera, S9 is not the best choice. But who cares about all the parameters like design, camera, performance S9 is the best you can get. Samsung had the best execution of bezel less display  without any notch. S9 is the best smartphone you can get right now.",0.1098,140

Great Video! The Samsung Galaxy S9 and S9+ look really nice. I have a Samsung Phone. I never had an apple phone before. The Samsung Galaxy Phones are really good to work with. I would like to say thanks for listening to your customers. I have seen a lot of new improvements on your new Samsung Galaxy S9 phones with the things like the fingerprint sensor location and the Bixby button. Thanks for that. Keep up the great work!,0.9802,89

I like how the Bixby assistant helps us translate and find different places. One thing I'd like to know more about- can Bixby hold a fluent conversation yet? It would be highly beneficial to have a phone assistant that can talk to you, and answer/respond just as another person would, giving Bixby a personality and human-like interaction. I greatly hope Samsung will look into improving and updating Bixby's A.I. I am eagerly awaiting Samsung's next designs!",0.9812,142

"No dia 05/02 entreguei o meu Gear Fit 2 Pro na assistência, o mesmo simplesmente parou de funcionar todos os sensores em apenas 3 meses.
Com 3 dias foi me dito que o mesmo seria substituído por outro produto e que a Samsung enviaria um gear fit 2 pro Novo.

Já fazer 39 dias e não foi resolvido e em vários contatos com a assistência e com a Samsung ninguém consegue passar informação sobre como será solucionado.

Samsung informa que tentou entrar em contato 6 vezes porém isso não é verídico , contra prova a isso estou ligando todos os dias pra a central de atendimento ou enviando mensagem pelo Facebook pra mostrar que ainda estou aguardando a lição.

Já tenho vários protocolos e ligações gravadas e ninguém consegue resolver.

Como serei indenizado agora que a SAMSUNG expirou o prazo legal para o conserto ou substituição do produto?

Ordem de serviço 57.151

Estarei ligando todos os dias para Samsung e gerando números de protocolo.

Segue os protocolos
