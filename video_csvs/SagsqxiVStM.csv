"""Racism is wrong unless it is against light brown people."" --Hollywood

The civil war started when Israel invaded southern Lebanon, under the pretext of pursing Palestinians, but with the goal of annexing parts of Lebanon--like the Shebba farms.  Hezbollah formed first to kick out the invading soldiers from southern Lebanon so more land wasn't lost. They were a Muslim group who protected Christians there. (I don't agree with their behavior since then, but they first formed to defend their borders). 

Due to this ensuing instability, many religious and secular factions and subdivisions vied for power in the political vacuum. Christians were killing other Christians. Muslims were killing other Muslims of the same sect and different political party. One of the many different types of Christian militias massacred Palestinian refugees--after Palestinians militias tried to take a piece of Lebanon for themselves when exiled by Israel but revenge killing is still wrong. This wasn't 2000 years of vendettas. This was at most a few years of discontent and upheaval. 

And we never a group called Islamic Liberation. That's just a thin veneer to associate wrongly Lebanon with ISIS. What the absolute bollocks. There were so many historical names of rebelling groups but that would show too much sense that this wasn't a crazy religious jihad but a civil war that petered out. 

Now a historical fiction about the complexities of the war would have been cool, showing virtues and flaws on multiple sides. The Maronites, Druze, Sunni, Shia, Orthodox, the myriad of secular groups, Israelis and Palestinians had good reasons and negative greed to make them complex characters. But this cop out is completely misleading and boring. 

This entire movie is...well, worse than Trump's sh*thole comment. But nothing new from Hollywood's racism towards us ""whitish brownish"" people. Maybe beige.",-0.9958,342

Yet they seemed to have no problem getting israelis to play israelis.. The film was shot in sepia in morocco...looks like a desert which lebanon is not.

"Remember the saying ""don't judge a book by it's cover?"" Well, don't judge a movie by its trailer either. This is 3 minutes of a 2.5 hour movie that shows only the most action-filled, thrilling parts of it, and people are already freaking out, threatening to boycott a movie that they have NEVER SEEN. I happen to have already watched Beirut at the Sundance Film Festival, and, while it is a thrilling movie, it is less about the action that is portrayed in the trailer, and more about empathy, and the personal journeys that all of the characters go through. And ""Beirut"" doesn't portray terrorists in the negative, stereotypical light that many Hollywood movies do -- one of my favorite moments was that in which the audience felt a degree of sympathy for one of them that brought many of us to tears. This movie's theme is an important one -- when we stop talking, chaos erupts. ""Beirut"" is also a historical drama, set in a time where Beirut WAS in fact war-torn. So, how can you expect the filmmakers to have filmed it in 2018 Beirut, which is now a completely different city than it was when this movie was set? Morocco was the only way that they could accurately depict what Beirut looked like at the time. When I watched ""Beirut,"" a man in the audience even raised his hand during the Q & A to explain that he had traveled to Beirut when this movie was set (1980s), and that the filmmakers did an excellent job of accurately recreating it. So PLEASE stop writing comments as if you have any idea of what this movie is truly about. As someone who as seen it, it is not whatsoever the racist, Hollywood-ified movie that you all are making it out to be. If you still have problems with ""Beirut"" after watching the FULL movie (which you should -- it's a great film), fine. But don't judge a movie by its trailer, please.",0.9755,385

"Wow, what a terrible ""film"".  This is an insult to the movie industry.  An insult to any ounce of truth. You should be a shamed!  This looks nothing like civil war Beirut, sounds nothing like it, the people are not Lebanese, nor do the Lebanese talk like this.  This should NOT be called Beirut, and is NOT even filmed in Beirut.  They couldn't film it in Beirut because Beirut is too gorgeous of a city to lend them the garbage they needed to film!

Lebanese are not isis and american israelians aren't savior. it should beonly about the palestinian christian war.
this film is only trying to give the world a bad idea about lebanon and remember we are not barbarians.

and guess what's this movie about? that's right beirut in the 80s. if you don't like it don't watch it and stop bitching, i am embarrassed to share a nationality with such cry babies",-0.3716,123

هذا الفلم مهزلة، ودليل على السخافة و عدم دقة المعلومات. فبيروت (التي يصفونها بالإرهابية) مدينة جبّارة مكافحة للإرهاب وموّحدة لشعبها  بالديمقراطية والوحدة الوطنية والتاريخ يشهد على ذلك. ستبقى بيروت مهد الحضارة مهما تداولت الأفلام والإعلمات والمقالات لتزيل هذه الحقيقة.,0.0,49
