Hey Lilly! I admire you so much for addressing the topic of wealth and growth and not judging people before you know them. Something I really look up to you for is that you are really funny and love to make jokes but you can also be serious and talk about things like equal opportunity with the same amount of passion and energy that you put into your humor.

"I just wanna thank you for the motivation, Lily. I'm having some doubts about my future as a scholar. I'm not sure whether I have it to make it, because there seems to be so many people who are much better and much more passionate about it than me. I just can't seem to be passionate even in the one thing I can picture myself loving. And my society is not very friendly to women in the workplace so basically I have to be noticeably better than my male peers to succeed and reach the top. I know that when speaking about social problems you shouldn't put it on the individuals to break through, but your video made me realize that when it's about yourself, you should face the problems upfront and not make excuses about it. Sorry if my words were not coherent, but I just wanted to get it out there and make a New Year's resolution.",0.6357,171

"Ok Lilly here's my thing. Nobody should be given preference because of their gender. At least 85% of female youtubers only do beauty, stuff with their boyfriends/dogs, fashion or lame DIYs videos. Those areas are over saturated and so that's why they aren't making as much. Furthermore these kinds of vloggers are usually drama queens who focus more on their looks and whomever they are dating rather than their hustling. Don't blame the men, most of them on the list are gamers and not necessarily for their creative content. One kid on the list basically reviews toys *rolls eyes* not knocking anyone's hustle. Maybe female youtubers need to be more creative and less vanity focused. I literally don't watch them for long. I'll watch a few of their stuff then get bored and move on. Another thing as soon as these female vloggers start making a little money they run and buy expensive house in LA with pools etc. They don't have much business acumen.",0.8641,185
