A tip from a stranger. Try to tone down the spiratic tendencies ie: Interrupting the dude while he is absorbing the information is a bit continuous. I understand you have to keep ur audience entertained but it was giving off them Jimmy Fallon vibes. Chill down a bit and then execute the actions take a sec to process the situation.,0.5187,65
