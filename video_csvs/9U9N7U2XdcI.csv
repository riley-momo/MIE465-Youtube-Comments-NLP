Jordanna Hall I believe its the network. Just like BET and VH1 are fighting over who will pay for Offset and Cardi B wedding. Who ever does the wedding. It will be free but in the expenses of the network chosen. Its not coming out of Ellen's pockets. They basically get it for free as long as you put their brand out there and there is a big celebrity behind it. I think it also depends on the views. The more people watching the Ellen show the more money the network gets and they get to give out prizes.,0.886,107
