Quick note: my grandmother is from Calabria and taught me how to make cavatelli as a kid, our family’s specialty, but we make ours very different: there should be ricotta in the dough and there should be ridges on the outside of the pasta, as if rolled on the prongs of a fork.

"Pasta is not originally from china, they use a different dough and italian pasta is not derived from any chinese contamination. The two types of food evolved similar in some aspects but separately.

Pro tip: make sure your pork filling for the tortellinis is slightly frozen. This ensures the very delicate fat does not melt all over the edge of your pasta squares and all over your fingers... Which is also why he's wearing food grade gloves.,0.4201,48
