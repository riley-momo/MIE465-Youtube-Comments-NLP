"Evidence that AntiFA did this is mounting. Their website 'itsgoingdown' had an article 9 days ago about pouring concrete on trail tracks. They have since pulled the article - but the intent was to derail trains carrying fracking equipment.  Time for the Government to round up and prosecute these Far Left domestic terrorists.  Nearly all political violence comes from the Left: Far Left National Socialists, Extreme Left International Socialists (which AntiFA is part of), the Weather Underground, and then all the Leftist criminal states: North Korean socialists, Soviet socialists, East German socialists, Chinese Maoist socialists, North Vietnamese socialists, Cuban socialists, Venezuelan socialists, Ba'athist socialists, Angolan socialists, Peruvian Shining Path socialists, Hungarian socialists, and on and on and on.

If you think (involuntary) socialism is the same as (voluntary) charity then you think that (involuntary) rape is the same as (voluntary) romance.  Socialism is slavery for the benefit of political elites - its camouflage is ""helping people"" but the only people it helps are the ruthless sociopaths that make their way to the top political positions.",-0.9612,212

"Positive Train Control or PTC will enable the railroads to replace human crews with robotic train control. The apparent previous ""upgrades"" that were done for the problem of crossing accidents would have more to do with crossing arms repairs and repair of block signals, and would not necessarily include track maintenance work on the rail itself. All railroads are absolutely loathe to admit that the cause of the most recent accident in question was due to poor track (rail) maintenance, and normally, the first thing the railroad does, is to do everything corporately possible to put all the blame on the crew running the train. PTC (robotic train control) will not be magically able to keep the train on the rail if the railroad ""cuts corners"" on proper track rail maintenance.",-0.9414,147

Friends, The Lord Jesus Christ is coming! 

The signs He told us about are here. Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus! 

The Lord LOVES you, He is not angry at us. So don't let the devil lie to you. Jesus promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, so come to Him today. Don't let anyone or anything, stop you from approaching Jesus. 

You don't need a fancy prayer, just come as you are and speak from the heart. Be real with Him, and He will be real with you. He will wash away your sins Alone, and He is NOT expecting you to clean up yourself. He will do it. He just wants you to come to Him now. 

Judgement is quickly approaching, and Jesus is The Only Way to escape since He already took our punishment on the cross. Thank You, Jesus! Hallelujah!
He did this out of shear love for us, so please find shelter and comfort in knowing that The Lord loves you and does not hate you. 

To die without Jesus is very dangerous, friends. So make Him your Lord and Savior today. 

Shalom.",0.9829,233
