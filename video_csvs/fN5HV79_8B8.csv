How she is not a normal woman yet shall be received a Award is totally ridiculous. People have to open their eyes to see who she really is, and why she pay nothing but a selfish lady without having a family and refusing giving her wealth to her own families. People are blacked out on her careers but real woman has to raise a question why she did not have any of being woman characters: labor pain, children, family, and missing her own family  growing pains.

"That speech is so amazing. And yet when you look closely you see it in the faces of some men. Not discomfort. It’s disgust. How dare a woman is lecturing. And some even have that how dare a black woman is lecturing us.

Yet the same men would listen in awe to the BS of Trump or some other bigot. And yet the same black men would rather vote for a known racist than a woman.

I know that sound harsh. But when you see the different reactions of men and women in this crowd you can see that invisible line between men and women become abundantly visible.

Oprah is the only American Citizen with a Collective Consciousness, a Light and Inner sense of GO(o)Dness that can quickly undo the filth and depravity that Trump represents. 
She is the only candle that burns brighter than the darkness that envelopes Trump and the Trump administration. 
It will be an era of greatness. A tremendous eight-years at a time in  our time in our Nations history that it is needed most, a time long overdue. 
A time where all of the Spiritual Giants like MLK and Maya Angelou, Wayne Dyer, Rosa Parks, Gandhi, etc move with grace into the White House as Oprah has been a vehicle, a sponge, a vessel that poureth over with the insight and light of all which is Source energy.

"The speech might give a spark in spines of many people........But it is speeches like these which are  a starting points of some distant future revolutions.

Now m not against the #metoo movement i personally think that it is something that we need for our children more than for us .

"Well, there is a story of four black adults kidnapping a disabled teen, holding him at gunpoint, tying him up yelling at him saying racist things about white people to him, forcing him to drink toilet water physically attacking him, and yelling insults about Trump, but speakers on CNN find it hard to say or didn't even say at all that this was hate crime. If this was a black person that was getting tortured, and held at gunpoint, the whole internet would be outraged and big political and pop culture celebrities would be posting motivational videos ans saying how this would be wrong. But the thing about this is, the first time I heard of the story and saw the video was only about a two weeks ago. This shows how fast it is spreading around(not that fast whatsoever) and affecting peoples viewpoints on how this should not be blamed on other things than those individuals actions and their motives. You could easily imply this story and how it was the opposite of Oprah's story given at 5:28 but it got way more that were effected and that said this was wrong than the other story. And you could easily say (and you wouldn't be wrong) that black people have the privilege in America. This is because they could claim police brutality and not have any proof, they say that they can't be racist, be completely discriminatory and place false stereotypes on entire races and go back to the past and say what white people did, but one fact, they say that white people were slave owners but lets face the fact, not one slave owner is alive today.

YAHUVEN SAY：You call yourself by MY Name, yet you watch her daily take the meaning of holiness and profane. Rise up and tell her, tell her for ME, you also are MY voices that must bring her back to the Spirit of repentance through MY Blood shed at Calvary. Tell her MY Children; tell her for ME it’s you she tries and pleases and not ME.",0.5267,78
