"I can't believe how pathetic some people are - and I;m talking about all those 'cool' guys coming here to spew hatred and mockery. Is it your kink to hate on something or what? The books/movies have one obvious plot - romance, romance, sex, some minor action, more romance and sex. Easy to figure out whether you like it or not. If not, then maybe just stay away from all related things? This is the third movie - are you all so slow that you still can't get whether you like something or not? If you just hate-watch it - cool for you, but stop spreading your cringe-worthy complaints and 'screams of horror'. You look laughable. I;m personally not a fan of books, though I enjoy the movies, but have you any idea how painful and upsetting every your comment is for true fans? People come here excited, they have been waiting for this, but you litter the whole section with your meaningless complaints. If you have nothing better to do, go and organize a club or something, but stop ruining the enjoyment of others. This movie doesn't pretend to be anything it is not - it is a sappy romance. Not your genre, ok, so just... move the hell on.",-0.8692,249
