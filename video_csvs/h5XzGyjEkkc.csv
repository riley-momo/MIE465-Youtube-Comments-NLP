"a good friend of mine adopted a roughly 12 months old female dog some years ago, and whenever i would come by his place to hangout she would sense me right from the stairs when i am walking up to his flat, start barking in sheer terror and when he would let me in she'd hide in a corner wailing and even releasing her bladder on the floor after she even gets the slightest glimpse of me. poor girl would be fine after some 15 minutes tho, even allowing me to pet her and chase her around the flat playfully like every other clumsy young dog would do after she would approach me on her own, but the initial response has been like that for years now. by the very own words of my friend she does that only when i flip by, and i have never ever experienced such reaction by other dogs before even once.
we came to agree it most likely is because she was being abused as a puppy, and somehow my physical presence reminds her of the abuser.
how anyone could do such thing to an animal is still beyond me, and it makes me angry to the very core.",-0.3818,217
