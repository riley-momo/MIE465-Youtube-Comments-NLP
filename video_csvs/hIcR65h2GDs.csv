"At this point, so much HATE have been cultivated as this present administration literally ran on a platform of HATE for women and minorities. Only love, compassion and empathy can bring back the civility that this nation needs. Even the supporters of this HATE administration from ""middle America"" and the poor south are seeing their jobs, benefits and rights taken away by an administration they thought cared about them, but are clearly showing with their policies that they only care about Rich white men.
Oprah or Michelle have the ability to bring back civility by way of showing America what love, empathy and compassion looks like before wealth inequality brings this country down to it's knees. Oprah have received billions under the American capitalist system and Michelle experienced privilege as a First Lady that will net her $120,000.00 per speech for the rest of her life.

It's time that they ""give back"" by using their talents and know how on how to bring this country back together.
EITHER one can pick Joe Biden as Vice President again as he would fully be able to handle domestic and international issues that neither woman may be able to stomach...kind of a Co-Presidency where the Vice President is given a little more power than usual so the President can concentrate on re-building America domestically. Biden would be a great fit to handle international affairs as he can bring some civility and normalcy back to Washington as many foreign states are very familiar with working with Joe Biden to get things done.
Trump is an utter failure and his Vice is even more evil..after these 4 years, America will really need a compassion, love and empathy healing intervention..Oprah or Michelle would be great persons to lead that intervention. Oprah or Michelle never served in the military, 2020 will be a great time for them to do that as Commander In Chief.",0.997,348

Particularly because she’s emphatically deflected — more than deflected, tried to put a plug in it, as she does here — all the buzz and clamor for a Presidential run, it is particularly offensive to me that our current White House Tenant, himself with so much trouble making rent, would reach out in jealousy and rage in a Tweet against her this past weekend. I won’t quote it. (But having heard about it first, and reading it from a screencap a few minutes ago on #Ellen, I just have to say, Donald, Donald.... what are jealous of, exactly, besides her money, her communication skills that surpass Reagan’s, her popularity? The quality of her speaking voice? Could it be her good character you envy, the trust and love she inspires in people? Or would you even recognize good character, or love, or ‘Trust’ as anything other than something bequeathed to you by a wealthy parent? Jeez smh...)
