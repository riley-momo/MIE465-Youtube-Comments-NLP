Really they're such minor inconveniences, if you even want to call them that.  It's a great phone, it feels premium, it's running next to stock Android, And it's got all the storage I can ever need. And the deal for it was killer.

That's why when you buy a device you make sure you get at a really cheap price so if the battery goes in it and not out a lot that's what I do never pay full price for the phone that's stupid always try to get a better deal on a tiny Bay or wherever eBay you get no deals either yet to wait a while before you get it,-0.0268,70
