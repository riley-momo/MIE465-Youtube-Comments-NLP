I think at the point someone kidnaps you and creates a mold of your face that could fool your phone you would probably rather be dead and could care less about your phone being unlocked.

Dumb marketing ploy and also a stupid video.  Face ID works well and keeps people out of your phone. Nobody is walking around with masks especially since they don't know whose iPhone they are stealing.

They are MORE likely to pull a fingerprint off the phone itself if it was left behind and create a rubber fingerprint mold (which has been shown to beat Touch ID very easily).  Your face isn't left behind if you lose your phone.

So what are we proving here?  That if you spent godless amounts of time and had free access to your own face to map and scale a mold of your face that you could unlock it with a mask?  Stop feeding the clickbait.",-0.9282,198

 Ở ĐÂU CÓ ƯỚC MUỐN,Ở ĐÓ CÓ CÁCH THỰC HIỆN !

Vietnamese researcher shows iPhone X face ID 'hack' 

Một nhà nghiên cứu người Việt Nam đã giải thích làm thế nào để anh ấy đánh lừa phần mềm nhận diện khuôn mặt của Tập đoàn Apple trên chiếc Iphone X mới bằng việc sử dụng mặt nạ được tạo ra từ máy in 3D,silicon và băng dính giấy.
Một tuyên bố vào hôm thứ 6 của Bkav-một công ty an ninh mạng Việt Nam: họ đã bẻ khóa được Face ID của Apple, và một đoạn phim kèm theo chứng minh một cách rõ ràng rằng một chiếc Iphone đang được unlock khi “chĩa” vào một cái mặt nạ,điều đó đã được hưởng ứng với chút ít hoài nghi.
Ngô Tuấn Anh, Phó chủ tịch Bkav, đã cho Reuters một vài sự giải thích, đầu tiên mở khóa Iphone với khuôn mặt của anh ấy và sau đó bằng cách sử dụng mặt nạ. Anh ấy đã “trực tiếp” để làm việc đó mỗi lần.
Tuy nhiên, anh ấy đã từ chối thiếp lập một ID người dùng và mặt nạ trên một chiếc điện thoại từ lúc mới đầu (ám chỉ chế tạo một cái mặt nạ cho người khác), anh ấy nói: Iphone và mặt nạ cần phải được đặt tại những góc rất đặc biệt, và mặt nạ cần phải được chế tạo, một quá trình theo anh ấy nói là có thể tốn hơn 9 tiếng.
Apple đã từ chối bình luận, liên quan đến việc một nhà báo trên trang web của họ muốn giải thích cách thức hoạt động của Face ID.
Trang đó chỉ nói khả năng ngẫu nhiên một người mở khóa được điện thoại của một người dùng khác với khuôn mặt của họ là xấp xỉ 1/1triệu,và so sánh với 1/50,000 cho máy quét vân tay đã được sử dụng trước đó. Nó cũng nói rằng Face ID cho phép chỉ 5 lần thử không thành công trước khi mật mã được yêu cầu.
Ngô Tuấn Anh đã công nhận rằng việc chuẩn bị mặt nạ là không đơn giản, nhưng anh ấy nói rằng anh ấy tin sự chứng minh nhận diện khuôn mặt như đã thấy là một cách xác thực người dùng tiềm ẩn rủi ro.
“Không đơn giản cho những người bình thường làm được điều chúng tôi làm ở đây, nhưng nó là một mối lo cho những người trong lĩnh vực an ninh và quan trọng cho những người như những chính trị gia và lãnh đạo tập đoàn lớn”, anh ấy nói.
Những người có quyền lực này tuyệt đối không nên cho ai đó mượn Iphone X của họ nếu họ đã kích hoạt chức năng Face ID.
Đây là trường hợp được báo cáo đầu tiên của những nhà nghiên cứu rõ ràng rằng có thể đánh lừa phần mềm Face ID.
Những chuyên gia an ninh đã nói vấn đề là không phải quá nhiều Face ID liệu có thể bị hack hay không, mà là nỗ lực bao nhiêu để hack thành công trong 1 lần.
Không gì là an toàn 100%, Terry Ray đã viết trong một thông báo, Giám đốc điều hành kỹ thuật của công ty an ninh mạng Imperva ở Mỹ. Ở đâu có ước muốn, ở đó có cách thực hiện. Các câu hỏi là: Có bao nhiêu trở ngại mà một ai đó phải trải qua, và họ sẽ phải tốn bao nhiêu thời gian để lấy được dữ liệu của bạn ?
Ngô Tuấn Anh của Bkav nói nghiên cứu đã được thực hiện trong 1 tuần, và đã có nhiều lần thất bại. Khung hình của mặt nạ được làm từ nhựa dẻo (plastic),nó được phủ bằng băng dính giấy để trông giống như làn da, với một cái mũi silicon và giấy cho mắt và miệng.
Quay ngược lại năm 2009, những nhà nghiên cứu ở Bkav đã chỉ ra rằng có các vấn đề trong việc sử dụng nhận diện khuôn mặt làm cách để xác thực người dùng.Họ nói đã hack 3 thương hiệu laptop khác nhau,những hãng mà đã làm ra những chiếc laptop sử dụng webcam để xác thực nhận diện người dùng.

"Tóm lại là mở được nhưng không khả thi, Sai mặt 5 lần thì bị khóa, bản đồ khuôn mặt được tạo ra là ngẫu nhiên. Thế thì nó lấy đt của bác xong là nó sản xuất được mặt nạ ngay à? Hay cứ sai 4 lần nó lại mang tới nhà các bác bảo: anh ơi, mở giúp em để em còn thử bản đồ khuôn mặt khác",0.0,76

We have no clue what the process for scanning the face initially done and if the taught the phone to recognize the mask. 3D scanning a face requires complex process and your cooperation to do that . Who would do that ? Anyone who is willing to open your phone will just force you to scan your face like touch ID,0.0772,62
"Well, I'm not a of iPhone fan but still i can bet on this video that it is fake because in iPhone X when the face id recognise the face, the lock icon on the top change to unlock and in this video every time the icon remain the same and i have seen too many videos related to iPhone X and in all that videos the lock icon change and in this video icon remain the same, and this video is too short to believe.",-0.4369,90
"What do you mean? He just did it in real world isn't? From what I know this is the first consumer mobile phone that truly inherit 3D depth scanner.

"Đây không phải video ""hưởng dẫn hack iphone X từ A-Z"" cho mấy con gà vs hacker nhé ;). Tin cậy hay không Apple tự biết. Bao giờ Apple phủ nhận hay gì thì hẵng đòi Bkav phải quay chi tiết. Còn nếu Apple không bình luận thì càng chứng tỏ Face Id có vấn đề.
Ps: Kể cả việc sử dụng passcode cho mặt nạ cũng chứng tỏ Face Id không phân biệt được mask với người thật. Nếu Face Id thực sự biết đó là mặt nạ thì chắc chắn phải yêu cầu nhập passcode chứ chả ai ngu đến mức cho AI học mặt nạ cả.
