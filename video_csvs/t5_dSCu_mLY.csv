"Although I am late at noticing this I'm shocked. I used to always watch you guys videos. Last week I was watching a few ones such as the compilation videos of him farting I laughed so hard and so much because it's been a couple years since I've watched you guys. But I'm sad to know that he's gone . I know the feeling man. I lost my aunt to ovarian cancer the month before you posted this video. I know it's hurts but keep your head held high, your dad will forever be in your hearts forever and be there for you in spirit. He's never left. He would want you to continue this channel don't stop. Btw, fuck those who may have made fun of you for crying. They're ignorant ass people. You take care:)",-0.6981,150
