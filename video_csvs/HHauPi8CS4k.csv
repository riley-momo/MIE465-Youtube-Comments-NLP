"Tbh this kind of makes me sad but disappointed I don’t get why she’s just crying over it like it’s just a haircut and it’s still your favorite furry friend it’s not like the dog will change or anything but the part that makes me more disappointed is that she’s judging the dogs looks (have she ever heard of “never judge a book by its cover?”) it’s still your furry pet!!!


Now before you hate on me I’m just saying this one last thing

Care for your pets it doesn’t matter if it’s ugly or pretty it only matters about how you care and love for it
