You say you love me
I say your crazy
We’re nothing more than FRIENDS
You’re not my lover
More like a brother
I known you since we were like 10

Yeah 

Don’t mess it up
Talking that sh❣️t
Only gonna push me away
That’s it !

When you say you love me
That make me CRAZY
Here we go again

Don’t go look at me 
with that look in your eyes
You really ain’t going away without a fight
You can’t be reasoned with
I’m done being polite
I’ve told you 1 2 3 4 5 6000 times 

Haven’t I made obvious?
Haven’t I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you ?

Have you got no shame?
You looking insane
Turning up at my door
It’s 2 in the morning 
The rain is pouring
Haven’t we been here before?

Don’t mess it up
Talking that sh❣️t
Only gonna push me away
That’s it !

Have you got no shame? 
You looking insane 
Here we go again

So don’t go look at me 
with that look in your eyes
You really ain’t going away without a fight
You can’t be reasoned with
I’m done being polite
I’ve told you 1 2 3 4 5 6000 times

Haven’t I made obvious?
Haven’t I made it clear?
Want me to spell it out for you ?
