"Did Warryn recently become Erica's manager because last I checked he was a producer and owner of My Block records not a manager.  Even if he is managing Erica, what works for one person doesn't necessarily work for others.  They would be the exception not the rule.  Most people who are managed by a loved one eventually fire that person or the personal relationship suffers.  Beyonce fired her father, Vanessa Williams divorced her husband that managed her.  That's just to name two but there are so many others.  Many people stop speaking to loved ones who manage them or end up divorced if the loved one is a spouse.  It is extremely rough on the relationship to be managed by someone you love.  Keep in mind that a manager works for you which means you have to tell them how you want things done and it is their job to get it done.  Vince works for Tamar not the other way around.  Anyone who thinks being managed by a loved one is easy and that it doesn't negatively effect the relationship has never been managed by a loved one.  Most celebrities go through several managers, regardless of whether or not they are related, throughout their career.",0.9836,222

Karen Mosley how could u come to that conclusionn when she is the ONLY one concerned about him having a safe alternatives to surgery and she is the ONLY one concerned about preserving the relationship.  I wouldn't want my manager toying with my shows to show how invincible he his.  She should be able to question het manager about anything and everything without him dismissing her or criticizing her.  Vince has shown his true colors and she has the right to want separation from management.  She was still trying to save the marriage but he's  to busy talking about getting mad bitches and he don't look that good.  He provokes her on purpose.  She has every right to be upset and need space.,-0.9435,130

She wonder why she was fired from the real. Those guys that she is always with will never keep it real because they is riding off of her. No matter who comes in her life after him she will always be that same big mouth person. She was nothing before him. She said that she wants to be happy but do she know why happy is!?..
