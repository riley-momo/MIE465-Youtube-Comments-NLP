Not wasting my money so Jon Travolta can make $30 fucking million dollars a film. So he can then go spread lies about that bullshit religion. Or all those other ass wipes who make millions and then watch this country go to shit and do nothing. Not saying all actors and actress are like that but majority of them. Majority of them make millions to live lavish life styles and do absolutely nothing for society.

"That the late-night talk-show hosts are ready to give up a large share of the audience to indulge their politics is something new in American comedy. Whatever Jack Benny, the Marx Brothers, Milton Berle, Joan Rivers or Johnny Carson might have thought about what was happening in Washington, they wisely kept it to themselves. When Charlie Chaplin was revealed as a Communist fellow-traveler in the late 1930s it hurt his reputation, though he never allowed his politics directly to influence his art. On the other side, when Bob Hope found himself, because of his support for the Vietnam War, aligned with Richard Nixon, many of his most steadfast fans deserted him.
