"Dear Friends, Jesus Christ is THE RISEN ONE who shines upon you always. Understand when you worship Jesus Christ you are worshiping a living Deity, not an idolatrous man-made image. Your relationship with Jesus the Christ is meant to be vibrant and challenging as He enters more and more into your life. Do not fear change for it is He who is making you a new creation, with old things passing away and new things continually on the horizon. Embrace all that Jesus Christ can do in your life and find your security in Him alone. Give your life to Jesus Christ this very moment and be ready for a loving, miraculous and awe inspiringly relationship that will span all eternity. ❤️❤️❤️                 (John 3:16;  Matthew 28:5-7;   2Corinthians 5:17)",0.9823,148
