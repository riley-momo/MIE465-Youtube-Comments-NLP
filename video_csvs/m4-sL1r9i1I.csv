I always cry when I see your video talking about your story. I just have to thank you, it's incredible and it's getting more and more at the top, you're inspiring me, Demi !!! So even if I do not see you coming to Brazil it does not look so bad because every lovactis will be there representing all the lovactis who have not had the opportunity to see her and sing together and meet her in person.
