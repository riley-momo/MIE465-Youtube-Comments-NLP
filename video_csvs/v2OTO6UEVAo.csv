"*마지막 때 : 의인은 결코 죽지 않을 것이고, 그들은 그들의 신앙으로 살 것이다.*

요한계시록 12:7 그때 하늘에는 전쟁이 있었습니다. 
미가엘과 그의 천사들이 용을 대항하여 싸우고 용도 자기 부하들을 거느리고 맞서 싸웠습니다.
8 그러나 용과 그 부하들은 전쟁에 패하여 하늘에서 있을 곳조차 없게 되었습니다.
9 온 세상을 유혹하는 늙은 뱀, 곧 마귀라고도 하고 사탄이라고도 하는 그 큰 용이 땅으로 내어쫓기자 그의 부하들도 그와 함께 쫓겨났습니다.

시편 139:19 하나님이시여, 주는 악인들을
반드시 죽이실 것입니다.
피에 굶주린 자들아, 나를 떠나가거라!
20 그들이 주를 악평하며
주의 이름을 더럽히고 있습니다. 21 여호와여, 주를 미워하는 자를
내가 어찌 미워하지 않겠습니까? 주를 대적하는 자를
내가 어찌 증오하지 않겠습니까? 22 내가 그들을 미워하는 것은
주의 대적이 바로 나의 대적이기 때문입니다.

마태복음 4:1 그러고서 예수님은 성령님의 인도로 마귀에게 시험을 받으러 광야로 나가 셨다. 2 예수님은 40일 동안 금식하여 몹시 시장하셨다.
3 이때 시험하는 마귀가 예수님께 와서 말하였다. “네가 하나님의 아들이라면 이 돌을 빵이 되게 하라.” 4 그러나 예수님은 마귀에게 이렇게 말씀하셨다. “성경에는 [a]‘사람이 빵으로만 살 것이 아니라 하나님의 모든 말씀으로 살아야 한다’ 라고 쓰여 있다.”

신명기 8:3 여호와께서 여러분을 낮추시고 굶주리게 하시며 여러분과 여러분의 조상들이 전에 먹어 보지 못한 만나를 주어 먹게 하신 것은 사람이 빵으로만 살 것이 아니라 하나님의 모든 말씀으로 살아야 한다는 것을 여러분에게 가르치기 위해서였습니다.

마태복음 4:5 그러자 마귀는 예수님을 거룩한 성으로 데려가 성전 꼭대기에 세우고 말하였다. 6 “네가 하나님의 아들이라면 여기서 뛰어내려 보아라. 성경에는 [b]‘하나님이 천사들에게 명령하여 손으로 너를 붙들어서 네 발이 돌에 부딪히지 않게 하실 것이다’ 라고 쓰여 있다.”
시편 91:11 그가 천사들에게 명령하여 네가 어디를 가든지 너를 지키게 하시리라.

마태복음 4:7 그래서 예수님은 마귀에게 “성경에는 ‘주 너의 하나님을 시험하지 말라’ 는 말씀도 기록되어 있다” 라고 대답하셨다.
신명기 6:16 여러분은 맛사에서처럼 여러분의 하나님 여호와를 시험하지 마십시오.

마태복음 4:8 다시 마귀는 예수님을 데리고 아주 높은 산으로 올라가 세상의 모든 나라와 그 영광을 보여 주면서
9 예수님께 “네가 만일 엎드려 나에게 절하면 내가 이 모든 것을 너에게 주겠다” 라고 하였다.
10 그때 예수님이 말씀하셨다. “사탄아, 썩 물러가거라. 성경에는 ‘주 너의 하나님을 경배하고 그분만을 섬겨라’ 고 쓰여 있다.”

신명기 6:13 여러분은 여러분의 하나님 여호와를 경배하고 그를 섬기십시오. 그리고 맹세할 때는 여호와의 이름으로만 맹세해야 합니다.

신명기 5:7 ‘너희는 나 외에 다른 신을 섬기지 말아라.
8 ‘너희는 하늘이나 땅이나 땅 아래 물 속에 있는 어떤 것의 모양을 본떠서 우상을 만들지 말며 9 그것에 절하거나 그것을 섬기지 말아라. 나 여호와 너희 하나님은 질투하는 하나님이다. .. 20 ‘너희 이웃에 대하여 거짓 증언하지 말아라.

로마서 1:25 그들은 하나님의 진리를 거짓된 것으로 바꾸었고 창조주 하나님보다는 그분이 만드신 것들을 더 경배하며 섬겼습니다. 그러나 길이길이 찬양을 받으실 분은 하나님이십니다. 아멘. 3:31 그러면 우리가 믿음으로 구원을 받으니 율법은 더 이상 필요 없단 말입니까? 절대로 그렇지 않습니다. 오히려 우리는 율법을 더욱 떠받들게 되는 것입니다. 마태복음 5:17 “내가 율법이나 예언자들을 없애러 왔다고 생각하지 말아라. 없애러 온 것이 아니라 완전하게 하러 왔다. 18 내가 분명히 말해 둔다. 하늘과 땅이 없어지기 전에는 율법의 한 점이나 한 획도 결코 없어지지 않고 다 이루어질 것이다. (이사야 66:22-24 - 마가복음 9:48)

하박국 2:4 “악인은 마음이 교만하고 정직하지 못하므로 살아 남지 못할 것이나 의로운 사람은 믿음으로 살 것이다.

시편 118:17 내가 죽지 않고 살아서
여호와께서 행하신 일을 선포하리라. 18 여호와께서
나를 엄하게 벌하셨으나 나를 죽게 하지는 않으셨다.
19 의의 문을 열어라. 내가 들어가서
여호와께 감사하리라. 20 이것은 여호와의 문이므로
의로운 자들만 들어가리라. 21 여호와여, 주께서 나에게 응답하시고
나를 구원하셨으므로 내가 주께 감사하겠습니다.
22 건축자들이 버린 돌이 집 모퉁이의 머릿돌이 되었으니

창세기 12:1 여호와께서 아브람에게 말씀하셨다. “너는 네 고향과 친척과 
집을 떠 나 내가 지시할 땅으로 가거라.
2 내가 너를 큰 민족의 조상이 되게 하고 너를 축복하여 네 이름을 크게 떨치게 하겠다. 너는 다른 사람에게 복을 끼치는 자가 될 것이다.
3 너를 축복하는 자를 내가 축복하고 너를 저주하는 자를 내가 저주할 것이니 땅의 모든 민족이 너를 통해 복을 받을 것이다.”
4 그래서 아브람은 여호와께서 지시하신 대로 롯과 함께 하란을 떠났는데 그때 그의 나이는 75세였다.

하박국 2:18 “우상은 사람이 새겨 만든 것인데 무슨 가치가 있겠느냐? 그것은 거짓 스승에 불과하다. 말 못하는 우상을 만든 자가 그것을 의지한들 무슨 유익이 있겠느냐? 19 나무 토막을 보고 ‘살아나라’ 고 말하거나 생명 없는 돌에게 ‘일어나라’ 고 말하는 자에게 화가 있을 것이다. 우상이 교훈을 줄 수 있겠느냐? 그것은 금과 은으로 입힌 것이므로 그 속에 생기가 없다. 20 그러나 나 여호와는 성전에 있다. 온 세상은 내 앞에서 잠잠하라.”

마태복음 21:41 그러자 그들이 대답하였다. “그 악한 사람들을 무참히 죽이고 포도원은 제때 열매를 주인에게 바칠 다른 농부들에게 맡길 것입니다.” 42 그래서 예수님은 그들에게 이렇게 말씀하셨다. “너희는 [j]‘건축자들이 버린 돌이 집 모퉁이의 머릿돌이 되었으니 이것은 주께서 행하신 것이요 우리 눈에 신기한 일이다’ 라고 한 성경 말씀을 읽지 못했느냐?

"‘Limited food, nourishment..’ Yep, due to US sanctions. The fact is if you oppose the US and her colonial and global hegemonic ambitions you must arm yourself with nuclear weapons otherwise you get invaded. Every country in the world has a central bank controlled by the world bank of which the US is the majority shareholder apart from Cuba, North Korea and Iran.. yep so called axis of evil, what a coincidence. War and regime change = a central bank controlled by the US and Rothschilds.",-0.8316,98
