One of the few that criticized it was former Celtics coach Red Auerbach. He argued that Stackhouse was one-dimensional, only interested in scoring, and was woefully ineffective without the ball - wouldn't or couldn't play good defense, set picks, rebound, etc. 

As it turned out, Auerbach was proven right. Stackhouse and MJ began feuding, and Rip Hamilton won a title with the Pistons in '04.",0.6799,116

"I will just say as a Thunder fan, I believe that Presti made these trades to sign Westbrook to a long term deal. He succeeded in doing that! Now, most likely, both George and Melo will opt and walk after this season. Then the Thunder will have Westbrook and Adams locked up. If the Thunder choose to trade George then most likely they won't get much so the risk is worth the potential reward. Maybe this team gets going and George decides I am not going to opt out and stay one more year. There still is a lot of basketball left and the Thunder are only 2 and half games out from the 4th seed in the west so it is not out of the realm of possibility that they put it together. Not to mention there are a few teams out there that have peaces to trade that would help the Thunder bench.

Melo is actually OKC's weakest link and as I've said in the past couple of years and that is if Melo doesn't change the way he plays(iso-ball) he will be out of the league in a few short years.

"give this team to lebron and see what happens. he is gonna mop even GSW with this one. something horribly wrong with this team. they are damn good in defense and they must be able to score at will. all 3 stars must get 20 each between them and other chip inn with 50! melo 20,george 20, wb 20. the problem is you cant teach old dog a new trick so quick.

you have to just maximize their potential. let them do their thing during their time and let all others block the opposite team to do their thing. like tyron lue does. though it is not great coaching it damn works with superstars.

so PAUL,MELO shares takes each 15 shots and 20 reserved for WB! so that is 50 shots between them for cool 75 points!

And than let other chip inn.
they have patterson to knock down. so other shares the ball and let superstars do their thing.

billy donovan is not getting it. he is still with last years style where WB handled bulk of ball handling and not scoring.

Also MELO should be with ADAMs when he is having hard time to dunk or post. there is no help inside. too much stand alone and shooting.

they have to do it like KYRIE used to do with CLEV. when hot he would knock down 3's but other time he would wreak havoc in the paint. PG,MELO,ADAMS AND WB all can do it.
It is inexplicable while these folks are not doing it.

these 4 must get 80 points between them. PERIOD. otherwise they would lose. And they can easily get 80 if they focus.

so you have to start playing from inside out. ofcourse when opposite team miss run and do not try 3 point . go for the  dunks as there is no body catch them up.

the problem is i do not see 2 folks running to help at all. when breakout happens WB is all alone. And only one superstars available when at least two must be near the ball.

Either coaching change has to happen or some personal change if this thing does not turn around.

they already have a template of how to play when they beat GSW. And the SPURS. that means they can do it. Only thing is they have to come focussed to win. 

Just hoping it will happen will never happen.

A tough test coming up right now and they have to start playing right away against INDIANA who are balling with OLADIPO going  NOVA!",0.6491,480

musicwelikemang Russle at the two and mellow off the Bench. They need a different point guard. Russ is too fast and strong to play the point at maximum effectiveness team wise. He moves too fast for his team to establish rhythm. Thats why he needs to move himself from the one. I think ego effects the thunder more than anything. Hes better as a iso player that dishes off to a third option after being doubled or collapsed on while driving. He would be way more effective(team wise) dictating pace from the 2 than the 1.,0.8625,107

rusty steiner Yea ur right but he's obviously the issue in this situation  he's not an elite player he needs to take a pay cut and come off the bench it's no excuse to play him in the starters but Billy Donovan is probably scared of him smh,-0.8519,48

scratch that melo staying with westbrook.  they better trade pg to the cavs...that man is gone. him and melo were suppose to be in cleveland. why would you make that trade. melo will be in houston next year if he opts out.,0.4404,49
sit melo a game. the team may be better,0.4404,10
"they need to change the offence, i would have westbrook bring the ball up and have him call plays to get george and melo open/ in iso situations. Like what the hawks did with kyle korver have them come off screens and lots of motion with them. i feel like if they ran more plays where they are not just standing on the three point line, run plays to get them open to get to the iso, not just start off in the iso. i like billy donavon but he is coaching very bad. Also have more minutes where they are not all three on the floor.",-0.2592,116
