We are being prosecuted in a daily basis! High tech lynching, institutionally racism! Especially for Arab women!  

Oregon former late A.G. Dave Frohnmayer had my SS# blocked & prevented me from getting employed, made me homeless and jobless!   

Dave Frohnmayer was the one who started & initiated the fraud of Foreclosed-houses & taking over our homes!  

His bank robber Rep. Bob Ackerman, Doug McCool, Margaret Hallock, Scarlet Lee/Barnhart Associates, forged my family’s signature, sold our fully paid Condo to Broker  Bob Ogle, mom Karen Ogle ”who was working in the USA Consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia""  She administered the power of Attorney!  

Bob Ackerman had never responded to the Summon from the Court, and the sheriff never served me or arrested him either!!                                                                            
ThIs is what kind of criminal government we have in Oregon!  Lock Him UP!

Doug Harcleroad, Alex Gardner told me they have NO JURISDICTION on Frohnmayer!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Oregon criminal Officials are complicit!  Lock Them UP!   

Both the EPD & Lane County Sheriff Dept. had been told to step down from investigating the bank robber Rep. Bob Ackerman & the rest of Lane County Criminal Officials are complicit with him!!  

I ran five times for public offices! Voter Fraud & Sedition by Lane County government to protect & cover up for the two criminals Frohnmayer & Ackerman!!
