As a Philly fan it gives me so much faith and hope that Stephen A doesn't trust the process. Stephen is always wrong so we will probably winna championship in the next few years.

He says go and grab veterans but what veteran wants to spend his career on a team that has no hope of winning. We now have a young team full of talent that actually has a shot at winning.

Let a real Philadelphian break it down for Stephen A Smith. You are wrong sir. Max totally crushed you on this. Max said it like the majority of this city felt. You clearly do not have your finger on the pulse of this city like you pretend you do. I respect you dude I really do but now I question if you ever really had this city in your heart like some believe you did. The process was something we Philadelphians believed in because we saw the pieces as they were added and knew it was inevitable that this team was going to end up with the potential of being a dynasty. Stop hating Stephen because you disagree. Do what Max did and actually look at the big picture for once. The sixers dropped prices dramatically during the process and if you actually went to a sixers game during the process they made sure you had a ton of fun while you were in the arena. I'm sorry sir but Max took you to school on this and here I was told you are a basketball guy. Pfft...white boy just showed you up on bball knowledge.,0.1664,210

They were burned out after Landry era, and used draft picks to slowly rebuild.   For a few years the Cowboys were horrible.   But celebrated later for successful rebuilding the franchise.   In the NBA it is Verbotten to rebuild via the draft.    And Sport media morons like Stephen A.  villify NBA teams that like Sixers down and out rebuild using draft.   Philly could not attract free agents, Evan Turner was their marquee player.  That says it all.
