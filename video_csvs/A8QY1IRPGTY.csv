Those numbers are all over the place, depending on which article you read, but I assumed you provided the article with the most civilian deaths.

And he was protecting the business interests of his country just like the President of the United States. And when you’re protecting the interests of the country sometimes innocent civilians die. Just like hundreds of thousands of civilians in Iraq, Yemen, and other countries all over the world who’s civilians died at the hands of the United States.

You did say that the Zimbabwean military was “Protecting” China right? China does a lot of business in Zimbabwe right? I mean they don’t own the resources or the economy in Zimbabwe as you claim, but you were still unable to provide evidence to backup your bullshit😂😂😂",0.4284,200
