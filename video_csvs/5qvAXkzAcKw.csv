Star Top ikr it makes u wonder whats really going on,0.2023,11
"Star Top more precisely, most of these disasters have come since the eclipse.  3 major hurricanes,flooding around the world,volcanic eruptions around the world , a major earthquake in Mexico, the fires and now mudslides in Cali. The arctic freeze that just hit most of the country.  All have come since 8/21 the eclipse.  And right now as I type a major earthquake 7.8 has occurred right off the coast of Honduras.  These things are written to be so it's everything I expected.  Not much longer before the return of the Lord Jesus.  I pray that you know him as your saviour. The only requirement from you is belief and Faith.
