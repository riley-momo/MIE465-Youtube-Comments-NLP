"+Cole and Marmalade
 I'm kind of torn with what you said at the end of the video/description box. 
I think such a catio is a great way to get outside for indoor cats. And many cats are okay with living inside, as long as someone plays with them on the regular and they don't get too much food. Some cat's don't even want to go outside. 

But there are cats who are extremely unhappy and depressed when you keep them inside. 

Sure, letting your cats outside is more dangerous than not doing that because of the risk of injuries, infections, cars or people in general and other stuff. I'm also aware that outside cats often have a shorter lifespan than inside cats (by 2 years or so). 
But I honestly think it's worth it (if you live in a relatively safe area, not right in the city, somewhere without too many roads). 

For example: My cats are coming from outdoor cats and grew up in a flat for the first weeks, then the people started letting them out into the backyard with their mother (supervised by them) for short periods of time. When they were with us and were at an appropriate age we let them out. Our first cat (a boy named Flisby) was let out a little earlier than his niece (not fully grown yet, but almost) and also alone without leash training before (of course we accompanied him the first time until he got more confident). He always was very tough and curious, so he was totally fine with it. It went great. 

Our second cat (Betty), his niece is quite a small cat and also way more cautious than him. We also let her out before she was fully grown, but we went outside with her on a leash before multiple times to show her the environment and so she could get used to cars, dogs, and birds. So when we let her out the first time on her own she was fine. She was only gone for maybe 20 minutes the first time, in the following days she got more self-confident and stayed out for longer. 

Now they are both around 9 years old and absolutely LOVE going outside. There are no problems with it. They are both very affectionate (in different ways), never bite or scratch anyone, very balanced cats. It also helps them not getting too fat ;). 

It gives them so much freedom (including freedom of choice) and so much quality of life. They love to lie outside in the grass in the sun, they love to hunt, one of them befriended the neighbours dog who basically lives on the open front yard and walks herself (used to live in the streets and got used to it). 

In Summer they are often gone for the whole day or the whole night, they love to play, hunt, eat (at neighbours) and chill/sleep outside. They also get to interact with all the other outside cats in our neighborhood.

If it's winter (I live in Germany, it doesn't get extremely cold where I live) they don't go out as much - still for some hours a day- they love snuggling up on the couch or in front of the fireplace. But we're always looking forward to it getting warmer because they become very unbalanced and annoyed if they don't spend much time outside. 

I honestly believe that my two cats would get sick and extremely depressed if we wouldn't let them out anymore. 
It gives them so much freedom, joy and quality of life that it's worth the risk.

And yes, cats are able to adapt, but having grown up with at least 4 cats at any given time on the countryside and then trying to have to cats in the flat after i moved to a major city, i can tell you, that they will be ever so gratefull if you finally let them out - it is not in their nature to stay inside and doing so is just the typical human way of putting human measurement on nearly everything. If you do not live in an area where you could let your cats out don't get cats in the first place .",0.7469,169

Depending where you live, eagles and larger species of owls have been known to pick up cats with their talons, fly up 100ft high and drop the cat so they can maim it and then kill it and eat it.

"Cole and Marmalade Thank you so very much!!!! May I bother you with another question (actually 2...lol) I rescued a kitten a couple months ago. She was stuck in my neighbors bushes. Poor baby had cuts all over her face.... I took her home fed her, bathed her & she's been with us ever since! Considering she was barely 3 - 4 weeks old & an outdoor cat - she was perfectly healthy. She's about 3 months old now. She use to be a ""mommy's girl"" but the past couple of weeks she's actually my son's little girl. She follows him, sleeps with etc... I guess I've never experienced this before. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy she's happy & feels love from both of us! It's just she use to be my shadow & my lil snuggle bud. Now.... I'm just the person who feeds her & plays with her here & there.... My question is why? Again, I'm not upset nor jealous. I'm so happy we were able to rescue her & give her a good loving home. And yes, we have other pets we've rescued & I can say she's the most spoiled! Can't help it, she has such a strong personality! I aware she thinks she's a human & not a cat!",0.9954,250

"I live in San Francisco, and there’s no way Siegfried VonKittykat can ever go outside.

It’s not his territory and he wants nothing to do with it.  

Siegfried is *soooo* much like Marmalade on cat trees!

"I would love to one day build a catio for our kitties. I grew up with indoor/outdoor cats, but also experienced the pain of losing beloved cats to wild dogs, cars, insects or other hazards they encounter outside over the years. When I moved into my own place with my cats I began letting them outside on their own for short periods of time. I was worried about them but at the same time they wanted to be outside and I felt guilty when I didn't allow it.

Then my neighbor's sweet old cat was shot by someone with an arrow. Two small dogs in the neighborhood were also killed deliberately by humans. I saw feral dogs coming through often, cars often speed through, so I made the decision to keep my cats in full-time unless I take them out with a harness and leash. It took some time for them to adapt but now they're used to it and they're safe and happy. 

 I'm not going to put down anyone who chooses to let their cats roam outside freely. I understand where you're coming from. However I do agree with Chris on this one, and from now on my kitties will always be indoor cats.",0.6653,225

"That's not exactly outside ... they could just get fresh air next to a screen door. Why not put that big cage on the lawn where they would at least have some grass. And also, the wooden fence blocks off the entire view. Cat's like to watch things outside. The big cage looks promising, but your location is very boring and in summer heat that wood floor will get very hot on tender paws.",-0.1505,81
That’s an amazing catio!,0.6239,7

This is absurd cats are not supposed to be kept inside or in cages or wear ridiculous outfits This is so horribly human values placed on animals cats are formostly animals and are terratorial and like freedom .,0.421,38
This is great! Can you tell me what wire you used around the perimeter?,0.6588,16

We have 6 cats outdoors and they are comepletly safe,0.4404,10
We have an outdoor enclosure for our two.  There is a tunnel walkway from the laundry into it so they have access whenever they want.  They are both 15 years old and still going pretty well.,0.6808,39
"We have six cats & we are so fortunate that our deck is very high, too high to jump from & we purposefully didn't put stairs leading down to our yard so they could all go outside & enjoy sunshine while bird & critter watching! They have furniture to sit on & lots of their larger toys that won't go thru' the rails.",0.8868,67

What fun they're having! I moved to FL last year and my house has ... a screened lanai! The cats love it! They didn't have anything like that back in Ohio where it's cold! I had a pet door installed in my kitchen door so they have 24-7 access!,0.8205,54

When you want to let them out you have to tell them to go to the far side and turn to face the fence.,0.0772,25

Wonderful idea!! Outdoor cats are in so much danger as you said. Thanks for the idea..safe and plenty of room,0.5432,25
Wow awesome!  This is EXACTLY what we need.  Our kitties want to go outside but we don't let them because we live by highway and near coyotes but this catio would be purrfect.  Where would one buy such a thing?,0.6588,44
"Wow, you lucky cats get warm spring weather while the Northeast has to suffer with bone-break worthy ice.",0.7845,20
Yes I have a huge tom cat called Spud who rules the neighbourhood he would hate to be restricted in anyway!! the  thing about Spud is his territory is very important to his feeling of being able to come and go Ialso foster three stray kitties at the moment they also use the cat flap and mostly hang out around the garden. Thanks for replying.,0.5827,69

"You are the best kitty Dad in the World.   Love this video!   Actually, I love all your videos.  Love Cole and Marm!",0.9606,27
You could have big flower pots and grow some cat grasses and cat nip for them to enjoy. Love your vids=^;^=,0.8126,27
You have your cats on a lead and have a catio? That’s sad. Just let your cats roam free like I do,0.4019,26
"You let your cat outside but in a cage! :O never seen that before. I let my cat ouside to do whatever he wants, let him enjoy his freedom. having a ""indoor cat"" is animal abuse in my opinion.",0.439,47
"You probably already know this, but that cat tower is going to get moldy fast. But so awesome for you to do this for your kitties!!  Maybe devise a way that they can always access it?  So they retain independence. 

Maybe a kitty garden?  Where they can dig and roll (and poop, you know they'll do it!) and maybe there's grass they can eat or Hosta leaves they can hide under.

Can you tell that I've thought of gardens for my own kitties?",0.8667,96
