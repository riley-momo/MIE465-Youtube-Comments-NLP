Okay, the only people I see who keep bringing this up are white women. I realize you all like John Mayer and you don't want him liking black women, so honestly you were thrilled when he made those comments almost a decade ago. You're not fooling anyone. I personally feel like people can and do change their views during the course of their lives. Some people change and grow which is what we all want to encourage. If he said racial things a decade ago and is now opening himself to different people, isn't that we want? Why condemn someone for being racist but then when they try to change their ways, you want them to stay in that same box? This is how I know you're not real, see.",0.3824,161

"I have been a John Mayer fan for quite some time. When I heard about this, it kind of surprised me.

He has always been so private about who he dates, and we only hear about it because of the girls he was with was hurt by his actions. I think John is really at a different point in his life, and I am happy for him. 

I don't think that fan asked a personal question at all, and John shouldn't get offended if people want a personal answer (since he did tweet about Nicki). You make the decisions that determine if people know about your taste in women, or whom you find attractive. 

I think we will see these two (Nicki and John) collab on a song together in the future.",0.9241,182
