"At what aperture that DOF/Bokeh comparison has been made? Because that Hasselblad looks absolutely rubbish. It was probably stopped down to match Pixel which is unfair.

"Couldn't have said better, mate. Another point worth mentioning is the accessibility of such technology to amateur users. With DSLRs, there is a learning curve to be able to take these kind of photos, you have to understand all kinds of dynamics like field of view, lighting, shutter speed, ISO and so on. With the 2XL all this is achievable easily cos of the software, soon your grandma will become a ""pro photographer"" too haha.

"I don't get what us so special with hassleblad gear! My sony which is now 900 bucks is half the megapixel size 100 percent crop is just as clean. I never understood the price differences besides maybe just because of their name. Same with Leica. I can get just as good of images with a sony A7 series camera for a fraction of the cost that is easier to use in everyway, especially focusing, and not cost as much as my house and car out together.  Different strokes I suppose. It's like photogrpagers who charge 20k for a wedding when their images are no better then someone out there who is only charging 1k. They know someone out there has the mindset that something more expensive equals better. Which is most of the time not the case.",0.9537,148
I don't understand why these YouTubers keep pitting new smartphone sensors up against pro level dslr sensors. There is absolutely no comparison. Yes on a purely technical level it is pretty dang impressive what google and apple have managed to do but you just can't get the same quality out of a tiny sensor that you can out of one 10 times it's size. Even if the tiny smartphone sensors performed identically to the medium format sensor the image still would not have the same quality and depth because smartphones will always be limited by their lenses,0.2813,100

"I personally welcome the comparison. I think every camera enthusiast knows the advantages of swappable lens and large high resolution camera sensors. BUT, instead of taking this as a comparison of just hardware, which everyone here likes to mention, look at this more of a comparison of current digital photography vs future computational photography. Throw in an iPhone X here, and you'll see how far ahead the 2XL is in taking more natural and properly exposed shots with far better dynamic range. So while the all modern high end smartphones run close up against the laws of physics with their tiny lenses and sensors, Google attempts to cheat this with math. The default HDR+ Camera mode of the Pixel 2 XL combines dozens of 12 MP photos with every shutter tap to achieve this impressive dynamic range. The artificial blur is created using the split sides of each camera pixel to get the depth information. That itself is damn impressive. And while it isn't medium format DSLR good, you'd think it was taken with something more than a P&S camera. On a sensor the size of a fingernail.",0.9842,207

I was scared when I saw the title but thank you for doing an honest side by side! I shoot with the Hasselblad that's how I found the video,0.6049,30
I wish I had time to explain exactly this in the video. The point isn’t that anyone in their right mind might be choosing between a medium format and phone camera.

I would've liked to see a variety of tests in real world environments such as in the outdoors in different lighting conditions. Whenever someone does a DSLR or Medium Format Vs Smartphone camera I almost never see them do any low light comparisons in fear that it'll show how much weaker the smartphone is. Or when they do they leave the DSLR on full auto to match the smartphone.,-0.6808,72
"I've known the Pixel 2 to have one of the best cameras on a smart phone, but I really did not think a smart phone camera would be comparable to professional camera like the Hasselblad.

"Out of camera they are going to look the same under the same lighting. Quite frankly, the phone would probably look better because of the software.

Now throw in lighting and post processing and a medium format camera is going to blow away any other camera on the market. A Hasselblad will get crazy fast sync speeds, while maintaining an open aperture, and it will produce raw files with incredible bitdepths which will post process much better.
