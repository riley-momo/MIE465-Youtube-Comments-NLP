"I have to think this trade out before I comment on it but I want the best for I. Thomas. He's been playing poorly and has been labelled a locker room problem. He's a good guy! I don't stand for him playing based on his relatively very low salary but he's been asking for a new deal for a long time and deserving one. I get why this weighs on him. It's financial security for his family and he's earned it and will produce. He's proud and he's getting screwed. He makes 6.2 million to Mike Conley's 30+ million. Fair?? That would make anyone salty. I strongly believe Thomas will turn back into the beast he was, with the Celtics, when he finds a team to invest in him. It's not just about the money. He was an MVP candidate in Boston and now no one wants him. You get what you pay for...one some levels. Thomas is a human being and he's playing depressed basketball. The NBA has a lot of max. contract guys at PG. Thomas played, and can play, at an all-star level and now no one wants to pay him. I'd be fucked in the head too.",0.728,229
