"As I played the game myself, I'd say this was not only a spectacular, well-made short film, it's very accurate to the game. I can remember a few moments that were in game. For example: 6:30, where the wife was after you accept that man, and she have false information. Gladly, the inspector let her in; just like I would do (for the sake for the medal and achievement). However, I don't remember them being Kolechian.

In terms of camera shots, they fit the scene very well, but I like how you edit the inspector finding key areas, like the Expiration Date, for example. Makes me feel like I'm playing the actual game without physically doing anything. I also love the suspense for any incoming reject stamps. It got me at the edge of my seat.

Well made Short Film for Papers Please. I really love it, and probably my favorite short film yet!",0.9895,181

"That was pretty fucking awesome. I played through Papers Please years ago, saw many of the endings because the world and choices were so gripping. You did a fantastic way showing how the player constantly feels trying to traverse a moral minefield. I was a bit disappointed there was no Jorji. I know you see his passport for a split second, but I feel like his amateurish attempts at deceiving the player would make for a pretty good scene. Maybe it would have ruined the tone of the film, which is obviously gritty and dark. But still, imagining him going ""Ah man, you funny guy!"" to the inspector (expertly played, by the way) when he asks him for a passport cracks me up.

Edit: I noticed Jorji actually was in a tiny cameo. I gotta say he does look the part, would still be great to see a full scene between him and the inspector.",0.9761,177
