"I don't know why I'm leaving a comment here really. Maybe it's the irritatingly monotone drone of your commentary or the ill-informed nature of your research. Perhaps you might want to dig a little deeper into British aviation history before posting up tripe like this. I'll freely confess I've managed barely a few minutes of it.  In a word - the malaise of the post WW2 aviation industry can be explained in a single word. Politicians. Gormless politicians led initially by Clement Attlee who gave away (for free) our best aviation secrets technology to the USA in exchange for - well - presumably something. Any takers on what that might have been? Do post up (someone) if you can enlighten us all on what it was. Maybe that explains why the C130 was so good. The Brabazon (you also mention) was a direct request from Churchill's war department who then dumped it like a hot brick when it was ready, beautiful and in the air flying. A few miles up the road is one of those 'sad' little aircraft museums you so like to sneer at. It once homed the Miles aircraft company. Miles made the first aeroplane that would go supersonic. All indications were it's engineers had cracked the issue of tailplane stability in a dive (the one thing no-one else in the world had managed). Attlee's clowns cancelled it. Bell aircraft in the USA stole the designs and their government built the X1 just a few years later Chuck Jaeger took the laurels with.

"If you look at any countries aviation history they all have their hits and misses. So picking out the failures just to show how bad they are is easy. As for the time it took to get them built and flying. The English Electric Lightening did its first flight in August 1954 where it went supersonic while climbing without the afterburner, supercruise. It went into service December 1959. Is that fast enough.

Interestingly the Lightening did a series of trials against the Lockheed F105 Starfighter. The low level supersonic acceleration was a dead heat. Everything else the Lightening won.

Not to knock what the US was capable of. The SR 71 was an excellent aircraft and the variable air inlets was a very clever design. I remember seeing news footage of a Nicaraguan firing his two 20mm canon from the back of a truck at what he claimed was an SR 71. Setting aside the fact the the maximum altitude his guns could fire was about 2000 feet, about 83,000 feet short of the SR71's service ceiling, it was also known for travelling faster then a speeding bullet.

If you enjoy the idea of ""what if"" the Lightening did on one occasions reach 87,000 feet and another 88,000 feet. Two to three thousand foot higher then the SR71. So if timed right could a Lightening have shot down an SR71?",0.5563,253

Not to mention the TSR2 and the Concorde.  All of which were very successful.  The Gurkhas would not decry the Javelin, because one which had used up it's ordnance, was skilfully flown by the pilot in Borneo, to make the enemy think they were being bombed, by using his engine power to make a large bang, scared the pants off the Indonesians, and saved the life of the patrol. The Gurkhas later presented a Kukri to the RAF pilot concerned. Considering the USA had 50 times the resources of the British who were struggling from ww2 financial effects and having to repay enormous lend lease costs (often for shit equipment), I think the UK did quite well. Not to mention the fact we often had crap Labour governments who wrecked much of our industry, and unions who delayed (with RED political leanings) much of what we tried to build. The unions also did the same in castle Bromwich in ww2 delaying the building of Spitfires for more pay, while we were at war. labour even gave the soviets our jet engines which they then copied and built into MIG-15s which ended up killing our people in Korea and elsewhere, very patriotic.
