But then again, why am I not surprised at how disgusting and shallow this fandom can be

After all, this is the same fandom that bullied a child actor for doing his job, and cut so deeply at the creator with insults so disgusting and hurtful that he gave up the world he created to someone else, and now coming after more actors and filmmakers with vile comments just because they didn’t make everything you wanted. 

Entitled and selfish should be the documentary of the Star Wars fandom

And really all the comments about worst character - but you all love Captain “what was her point” Phasma and General “dramatic shouty comic relief” Hux just fine, and oh look, white characters but sure, Rose is the worst because how dare a woman of color does her part to help and fight for her people",-0.9226,179

Lando was a diversity hire but he was smooth, charismatic, rational and felt natural to the plot. Rose was manipulating, forced, pretentious and selfish.

"The character sucked, her acting sucked, every scene that she was in sucked, the casino scene made me want to throw up in my mouth a little. I’m a first gen Star Wars fan. I saw the original in 1977 when I was 6 years old. I thought that Rogue One was awesome. The force awakens was so so but this movie was the worst!! I love women don’t get me wrong, but there were so many women in this movie that if you watch all the movies together as a whole, you see a significant jump in female characters. It just doesn’t look right when you compare it to the other movies. Where were all the females in the other movies? They just appeared....just like that. The political undertones made my stomach turn. And flying Leia...what a joke. Disney has ruined Star Wars for me. Thanks Disney.",-0.7035,177

"To all the Rose/Kelly Marie Tran haters:

I wasn’t the biggest fan of Rose Tico as a character, but hating on her actress is a low blow. Also, Kelly got to be in a fricking Star Wars film, something I dreamed of doing when I was a small child. And she made more money for her work than any of you “Star Wars fans” will ever see in your lives. So go back to your moms basement and write your fanfic where you and Princess Leia kiss, or whatever it is you haters do.",-0.9622,109

"Trish Armijo
Glad I'm not the only who thinks like you.",0.6705,12
"Unlike most commenters here, I appreciate her as an actor and her character.  She may seemingly be like a token character but she carries the important business being Virgil to Finn's ""Dante"". What she taught Finn about the dark side of Canto Bight's opulence was the catalyst of Finn's resolve, not only to try saving a friend, but to adhere to the principles of the Resistance.  In contrast to her sister, who was one of the celebrated pilots and gunners, Rose's creds might not be much, but her heart is aligned with the principles of Adm Holdo & Gen Leia of not needlessly sacrificing the lives of others in exchange for pyrrhic victories.  We know so much already about the conflicts between the ""big guns"" of the SW universe, Rose and Finn's dynamic showed us how it tough it is for the ""lowly"" foot soldiers of both sides of the fence. Rose was not just Finn's Virgil, she is our Virgil.",0.9511,181

Vivi Li I agree with you. I mean seriously people think Jar Jar was better? JAR JAR? I hope to see more Rose in episode 9. I think she's more similar to Lando than Jar Jar.,0.7882,41
