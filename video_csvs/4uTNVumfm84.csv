"Here's a summary:
Adam puts a scorpion on the girl. The girl pours wine on him. She screams spit everywhere. He sees her but then she disappears. Her face turns into mustard and kechtup. Girls come out of no where and fight him. He has a dream he is in a bath tub with her. He falls in a see of hers. He almost drowns in a car filled with water. Bombs come and she flies away, (dun dun dun dun non non non dun dun dun) She packs her bags and leaves in the car. The string attached to her car makes everything go away.",-0.9054,121

It's a special occasion
Not invited, but I'm glad I made it, oh
