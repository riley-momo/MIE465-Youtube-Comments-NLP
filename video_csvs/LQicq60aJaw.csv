How many of you want a Queen that has public pictures of her boobs hanging out or a TV star.  She is an Actress that grew up in Hollywood.   She knows how to play many parts well.  Henry is so very naive.  Falling in love in 3 minutes is called infatuation.  Henry has never been considered the brightest bear in the woods.  She is far more educated  and experienced than he is.  Sad situation.,0.7708,82

"It's really weird for me to hear anyone be called Your Royal Highness in the 21st century.

That can't even achieve the basics of a respectable civilization: loving each other, living in peace and harmony with each other, making sure no one is hungry or homeless, educating everyone properly. The ability and resources are there in tremendous abundance. Just no willingness to do what is right, just, loving. Although many people say we (the human species) are all growing, awakening, becoming more aligned with love, peace and joy. Hopefully these persons are correct.",0.9943,136
