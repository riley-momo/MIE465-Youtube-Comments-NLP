So what if she met a dude online on a dating site. I'm talking about a regular normal guy who is 20 as well. Is this acceptable? There's nothing illegal about it right? Lol. say they start dating and going out a bit. Wow I just realized that having sex would be so weird because of how small she is for one. That alone seems messed up. If she gives consent then it's all good right? I feel a dude would hurt her in bed tho even by accident. I'm sure someone would have issue with it. Can she have kids? I feel like no. Would her parents let her date some dude knowing they are physical. Just seems wrong I dunno...,0.7221,137
