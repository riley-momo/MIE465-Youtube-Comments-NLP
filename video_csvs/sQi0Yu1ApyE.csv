Here in the south we are raised with guns in the home from birth and you are taught not to mess with it. It's not a toy. And for the avg. folk who can't afford security you own a gun to protect yourself. I raised 3 sons as a single mom n my boys all survived and they didn't touch my guns! Seems more like a gun propaganda move on this episode. Always following what the liberal agenda deems for evbody..... Just my opinion.

Kim has been notice doing anti-second amendment talks and meetings yet she “ supposedly” got robbed? Then she shits on owning on stating she isn’t comfortable having one around her family but her husband makes a living by raping about gun violence....Once again another celebrity pushing anti-gun propaganda while living in a gated community with private security...thanks Kim how did that plans Parenthood episode go?,-0.9596,131

A hammer is used to build things and people still get injured by it when they don't know how to hammer a nail. On the same token, hammer is used to kill people because someone with a wrong intention used something that is so useful, to use it to kill someone. 

All I am saying is that anyone can make anything as bad as the person who is holding it.
The only way to stop a bad person with a gun, is a good person with a gun. It's better to be a warrior in a garden, then to be a gardener in a war zone.

"If you are for gun control, then you are not against guns, because the guns will be needed to disarm people. So it’s not that you are anti-gun. You’ll need the police’s guns to take away other people’s guns. So you’re very pro-gun; you just believe that only the Government (which is, of course, so reliable, honest, moral and virtuous…) should be allowed to have guns. There is no such thing as gun control. There is only centralizing gun ownership in the hands of a small political elite and their minions.

Just like they say, people will make war no matter what they use. If we don't have guns, they'll use knives. Take away the knives. they'll use arrows. Take away arrows, they'll use stones. Take away stones, they'll use sticks. That's just the Very nature of mankind. And mankind been warring since it's existence.. If you Really want to stop gun violence you should invent a time machine and go back to the 1960's/70's when they were making a bunch of cowboy movies that glorified guns and shooting and killing. And take away toy guns, and those assassination/fighter type video games. The problem with our generation is we have desensitized people from an early age and made guns and killing fun and games. Take all this back the last 60 years and you will see a whole lot less killing and a lot more people still living.
