"This is great for Gabrielle, one step closer to a wonder woman role for her! Jesus is coming back, the cold weather, the erratic Washington, DC crowd, all a sign to those who want to see it. What to do? Live a righteous, holy life. You nor I can do it alone. We must ask God for forgiveness, we must forgive those who hurt us. We have to leave all the junk alone...you know the R rated movies, the lying, the killing, the stealing, the swearing with God's name, the sexting, the sexing, the adultery, the hating because someone else is doing better, the gossiping, the witch crafting, not respecting parents, not keeping the holy Sabbath from Friday sunset to Saturday sunset. Most important of all, take time to know a great, Almighty, sovereign King called God. He loves you and wants the best for you. He is the One True God who never leaves you, nor stops loving you. His love is never ending. More recently I have to testify that when I needed a job with minimum experience, God opened a door for me that was all expenses paid, I only had to show up, training provided, and no reference nor interview on  my part was needed. I was simply referred by my sister and I got the job.  The recruiter did not know me nor my sister. So, God can do MIRACULOUS, WONDERFUL, IMPOSSIBLE THINGS.  Just trust him and try him and you will be surprised.",0.9516,297
