Carlos Garcia im sure they were happy to finally WIN. Love never made the playoff in MIN. Great stats on a terrible team means what? He's had more success as a third option than bring the main guy. And of course their points were down since they dont get as many shots. Did LeBron cause their rebounds to go down as well.

Could somebody explain to me how KD went to the Warriors to best LeBron. Because let’s think through this. In order to beat LeBron (since the regular season doesn’t matter) he would have to play him in the Finals. How tf are you going to get to the Finals if you have to play the 73-9 team.

"Got it.  Triple doubles > Finals win + MVP.  

LeBron makes EVERYONE around him better, except for star players, rookies, etc.  Gilbert Arenas and Jamison, ball hogs, brought a better version of Larry Hughes out; as a 3rd cog.  Hughes with James, as the 2nd cog, and krrrrpklunk.  Wade ceases being great, to let LeBron be great.  Bosh has slide over, and reinvent his game.  Love, same.  Kyrie, same.  

Durant is spoiled with a star cast.  And that cast, still produced as well, and more efficiently, than they had without Durant.  They won in Year 1 with Durant.  

LeBron goes to GS, flip Durant out, and Klay would have to get traded for some reason, Curry would have to stand around more, Green would be occupying the same areas of the floor as LeBron, so of course, he'd have to do something else and be less toolsy and less of a glue guy, the ball is going through Mr I DO EVERYTHING well, so there's less ball movement, etc.  People would be going on about how old the Warriors are, the bench is suddenly viewed as weak, Kerr's a terrible coach, and apparently, LeBron is saddled with a team that doesn't try.

Meanwhile, KD, Love, and Kyrie, are all having a blast.  Thompson is a double-double machine and loves playing the game; 2nd Team All Defense.

LeBron is a PER God, he's one of the 5 greatest players, but enough with he makes everyone better, and Durant sold out by leaving triple double GOD Westbrook in the rear view mirror.  

Klay still averages 20, Green still puts up big numbers across the board, Curry still gets 25 a game, Westbrook still put up great numbers while playing with Westbrook, Harden came through OKC and look at where he's at today.  Which of the two players is better to play with, while still allowing his teammate to play at the same level, and be confident doing so?  Assists are - at times (Kobe/Westbrook) - are overrated, and playing off the ball (Jordan/Durant), is vastly underrated, and allows your teammates to do what they're good at.  Pippen, Grant, Rodman, Kukoc, still produced as they should have, with Jordan.",0.9952,445

They'll win 4 or 5 tittles. BOSH became a shitty and a non factor player. KEVIN LOVE was a beast in Minnesota. A leader. Taking the league by storm. He joined LeBron..... Kevin love became another player. A piece of trash. Only standing at the 3 point line. Not moving. And has limited his game. Even though he's averaging 20 plus pts but most of those points come from rebounds. Kyrie IRVING don't wanna play with LeBron. ? No wonder why.

"Jalen Rose is usually right about this stuff, but he has the 2017 Finals totally wrong. Just ask Kyrie Irving: LBJ's stat line was a vanity stat line. After game 5, Lebron looked pretty happy with himself, he got out the series with a terrific stat line.  Was the outcome of the series a forgone conclusion? Absolutely not. Everybody seems to forget how dominant the Cavs looked destroying the East, and more than a few people picked them to beat the Warriors. Game 3 was totally within grasp...

And if you looked at Lebron's stat line you'd have to wonder, what happened? What happened was, Lebron's 4th quarter point TOTAL for games 1-3 was a whopping 11 points. What does that mean? It means Lebron was taking care of himself in the first 3 quarters of those games, and leaving nothing in the tank for crunch time. Who played just as many Finals minutes as LBJ but DID have the juice when it mattered? 

KD.

It as absolutely absurd to say that a guy who totals 11 points in the 4th quarters of 3 crushing losses somehow outplayed the guy that was dominant from series beginning to series end. PLUS Lebron played absolutely ZERO defense in that series.

Litezout when MJ was the best player the ball wasn't in his hands all the time.  He played in a system.  Of course they didn't win because they have to play in the Lebron system which means you have to be a spot up shooter.  Lebron doesn't allow anybody to handle the ball.  Lebron cant play without the ball.  Step Curry and Durant can play with the ball or without the ball.   Lebron is a ball hog just from a passing stand point that's why Kyrie left.,0.8427,94

ball handling, court vision, passing, post up defense, help defense, being the screen man on screen n roll, weak side cutting, rebounder, weak side defender, posting up, getting to the line/ in-traffic dribbler, clutch stats (look it up), durability & endurance (if you think this one is close, you're just trolling). And i don't know how many more I am missing.

If KD is your best player, you still need a point guard and a guy who can rebound.

You don't know what you are talking about Jordan was in the league for 7 or 8 years before Pippen got there.  Jordan was winning MVP DPOY MVP awards without Pippen.  It was Jordan or nothing,0.7506,38
You're the one not making sense. Pippen gradually got better himself until he became the perfect complement to Jordan. Most NBA players didn't put up amazing numbers their rookie season they gradually got better and better the more they played. However you feel about Pippen and Jordan my point remains that KD isn't as good as LeBron. Why is it that everyone compares LeBron to Jordan but not KD to Jordan. Because Jordan never joined the team who beat him after blowing a 3-1 against them. The move to Golden State single-handedly killed whatever case KD had for being better than LeBron or Jordan.,0.2264,111

"so every1 is bashing KD for going to Golden State  - okay... Do you all forget that Lebron got beat by Boston Celtics in 6 games in 09 - 10 season?... so what did Lebron do? Oh yea he took his talents to South Beach to form a Super team involving 3 perennial all stars...  Then in 2014 HE CAME BACK TO THE CAVS BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS GREENER IN THE LAND IN THE FORM OF A YOUNG SUPERSTAR NAMED KYRIE IRVING! Where he tried to Recruit a Superteam himself, D Wade (One of the greatest SG of all time) Derrick Rose, etc etc. and when THAT didnt work out... the GM took the reigns and now he is STILL PLAYING on a RIDICULOUSLY STACKED TEAM - so why is KD getting all the hate?... if Lebron has been recruiting pieces since he FIRST LEFT CLEVELAND???",0.8968,164
surpassed what?? 1 is better than 3 rings>>?? for a teams the hell.. drink a venom please3,0.594,25
that's because its Lebron system.  Lebron don't want to give up that control.  Tell Lebron play without the ball and let Isiah run the offense. Of course he want do that lol,0.4129,35

😂😂😂 yall all jokes KD never said he was the Best in the World than leave his team to make a superteam in Miami... So in that case yes KD did up him on going to GSW but lets make things clear he didnt go to a 73-9 team yall better go check them rosters 2 totally different teams.. So for that reason if KD cant be the Best neither can Bron 😴😔,0.946,78
