"As a person who live near this market, it’s might be a good idea to share something that you should know before visit the place.

1.Always pay attention to your safety. I’ve seen some tourists who worried too much about taking a good photo of the train and forget to looking around them self. Some little accident might happen. 

2. If you taller than 5’8, you gonna have a problem while looking around the railway market. Because of the “awning” in there just... so short. 

3.If it’s a rainy day the place could become wet and stink. Watch your step  or might slip while walking in the railway.

4.The traffics around there are really bad lol. The road are sooo small and people have to walk on the road because the shops are on the sidewalk.  (Yeah, I know. Isn’t a sidewalk was created for a people to walk and not hit by a car?)


These are my thought that I think people should know before visit the Railway Market. But I’m curious. I mean, why are people think that this is amazing? Could anyone who had visited this place before answer my question?",0.6926,232
