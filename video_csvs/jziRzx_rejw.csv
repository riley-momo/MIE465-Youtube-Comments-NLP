He got a high score because of his quads and the only record he has is the record for the highest TES in the FS (and if Yuzuru wouldn't have been completely underscored at the World Championships 2017 and Nathan Chen overscored at the Olympics 2018 then he wouldn't even have that) and that has nothing to do with being artistic.

"2022 here we come!!! Nathan cracked under pressure, which some say doesn’t count since he didn’t deliver when needed. Let’s keep in mind that he’s 18, and was “America’s hope” All the pressure was on him. Yes he didn’t deliver in his short program or the team event, but his long program made history. 

People need to stop getting on him. People who went into the Olympics liking him, and are leaving hating him, give him a chance. He cracked, it was bad. He just needs to learn to control his nerves, let go and block everything out. His score would’ve got him gold in Sochi against Yuzuru, so that’s saying something. It’s the Olympics, it’s completely different from anything else, I can’t imagine what goes through any athlete’s head when they make it. 

He’ll come back, and all of his doubters will regret ever doubting him.",-0.9732,199

Every athlete has some kind of pressure, no matter how big.. it's still a force. Hanyu, for example as almost everyone compares Chen to him, couldn't skate like he wanted  because of his ankle injury 4 months prior. He didn't even know if he could move his feet or skate in time for the Olympics. He also carried his entire nation's pride since 2014 at that event on top of defending his gold title mind you.

Even when he was 17, he came alive in front of big crowds and absolutely loved to be on the big stage. Nathan looks to me more of an introvert than Hanyu.

Sure it was very impressive that he landed 5 out of 6 quads cleanly in the free skate, a great redemption for himself indeed.  But the quality of his jumps are average, and there is nothing much going on between his jumps.  I wouldn’t exactly call it a balanced program tho I can understand some ppl do get excited with all the jumpfest going on in that program.  But he’s more than rewarded with high Bv (and too generously scored on GOE and PCS).  Nathan is taking the high risk high reward route so far and there’s no right or wrong approach per se.  But based on what he puts on ice currently, there is very little artistry or skating skills demonstrated.

Of course Yuzuru capable of getting a higher score.  They both are.  Also, it was Nathan's first Olympics.  He will only get better.   Nathan broke three records with his 6-quad free skate, which the commentators brought up.  I agree Nathan should work more on his artistry.  He still got the highest score for the long program in these Olympics, so if Yuzuru wants to defend his title in the 2022 Olympics, he will have Nathan to contend with.",0.875,107

"Why does this feel like a rewind of young Hanyu? Back when he was only focusing on one thing (can't remember what it was - I'm the farthest from an expert here), but Brian Orser made him see that he needed to focus on a good foundation before moving forward, and THEN you can fine-tune whatever you want to focus on. I firmly believe that is how Hanyu got his gold medals. He had a great coach who knew the right way. This is just my unprofessional opinion, so help me out if I'm wrong, but it seems to me like Chen also needs to build a stronger foundation first, before moving on to greater programs and scores. 

That being said, Chen is still amazing - all these young people are, and the pressure they're under is seriously no joke.",0.9603,155

"Yeah, but that's only in the Olympics. We're talking about all-time here (which means that Yuzuru is capable of getting a score similar to or even better compared to the Olympics' current top score for the free skate). In any case, he didn't break any records (score-wise for free skate) despite his 6-quad free skate. He is good though, it's just that he needs to practise more on his artistry. Once he does, even if he falls on his jumps, he'll still be able to lie back on his pcs.",0.9822,107
Yes I believe young Hanyu too once wanted to focus on quads and Brian instead made him polish his basic skating skills first. I'm no professional either but I do remember Hanyu saying that in an interview. So glad things happened the way it did for him :),0.8654,50

It wasn't my intention to put down Hanyu because I truly don't have anything against him ... I never did say anything bad about him and never said he was feminine ... just more to the point that Nathan was so athletic and strong. But by agreeing with that person, that does make me guilty of that comparison, which I truly didn't intend and regret that part. So I am really sorry for that. And yes, my real faves were actually Petrenko and Plushenko back then ... I wanted Plushenko to win, but it was Lysacek instead ... but everything is a progression ... and now it is Nathan's turn. I do get tired though of hearing how he isn't artistic, but I really should know better not to react to that...cause I end up in a bigger and deeper hole. lol",0.9622,192

Petrenko and Plushenko were my favorites. And now I love Nathan and think he is incredible. I did say he doesn't need to be feminine to be artistic and just because he is athletic doesn't mean he isn't artistic and graceful. He has his own unique style about him and is so athletic and strong. My points were all about Nathan and just to reiterate I never said anything bad about Hanyu or any other skater.,0.9753,130

"skater How nice of you to think Yuzu would want to defend his title in 2022. I'd like it if Yuzu still skates by that time but I also worry for his health. Another four years of this stress would surely make me bald. Yuzu did the Olympics through sheer will, determination, and painkillers, as he is still injured. That's why he only did 4S and 4T. If he didn't botch his 4T combo and 3Lz then his score would be way more than Nathan's. Even with just Yuzu's 206 score in the FS with 4 quads, 3 landed cleanly, if compared with Nathan's 215 with 6 quads, 5 landed cleanly, that's amazing. Not to mention Yuzu only did 4S and 4T which have the lowest base value of all the quads. Nathan did a 4Lz which has the highest base value next to the 4A. Nathan also did 4F, higher BV than 4T and 4S. And now Yuzu is planning to add 4A.",0.7525,183

Just because we fans who like Nathan, doesn't mean we don't appreciate other skaters. I have grown up watching my faves that came along like Hamilton, Petrenko, Plushenko, and yes even Hanyu ... just to name a few. I've even loved skaters who weren't the big names. But now Nathan has come along and I am so drawn to his strength and grace as well. He has ballet movements that I have noticed from watching my daughter perform ballet for 12 years. So those who don't see his artistry chose not to see it or have to compare it to another. But I see Nathan for his unique style. I will be rooting for Nathan and continued success!!",0.9927,172
