"To seanodinihio, you most know what you are talking about, SONY didn't want the PS4 to have a backward compatibility simply because they DON'T want to, its because the PS4 OS ( Operating System) CANT DO IT without been hacked, the PS 1 got hacked in his first year, the PS2 got hacked in his first year, the PS3 however got hacked in his 2nd year through a program called the Multi Man, SONY Playstation had to come up with a new OS for the PS4 and the VITA that cant be hacked, and that is the true why the PS4 CANT run backward compatibility due to its new OS that is not compatible with the old OS that PS3, PS2 and PS1 used to work on, and that is why every old game that run on the PS4 been redone to work on PS4 OS, and also that is why PlayStation NOW work on PS4 as a streaming service to insure that there is no hacker can hack the old games while running on the new PS4 OS,  HOPE this help you understand why SONY PS4 don't have backward Compatibility better ^_^",0.959,208
