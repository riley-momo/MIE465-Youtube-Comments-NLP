"I have a theory about this whole era. The tour's pretty short in terms of number of dates. She's been pushing singles faster than normal this album cycle, and she's not doing many award show performances or interviews. This album addresses some things that have plagued her for a while, so I think this whole era is a catharsis for her. Getting frustrations out and calling people out on their shit, and just like a catharsis, it's short-lived but feels good afterwards. What if this whole era is supposed to be shorter than normal because she's got Album #7 already close to finished? And what If that album's gonna be the happy after the anger?",0.4561,127

"Taylor! Please come to Adelaide for a Reputation Tour! The last time you were here I wasn't allowed to go, but now that I've got the scholarship to my dream music school (because I want to be a musician like you) I can finally go see you sing as long as you're in Adelaide. But I'd just found out that you're skipping my home town and going to Perth instead. I was REALLY looking forward to seeing you (and maybe Joe) here in Australia! But now I guess I'll have to wait 'till your next album... I'm really upset Taylor and I'm begging you, PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE come just once to fill my dream. (And if I ever succeed on my career as a possible famous singer I want to tour with you!) 
Love you Taylor! Coming to my home town would mean soooo much to me!😍😘",0.9854,170

"Why you never visit South America. There are many swifties there who want to see you sing live. You have not visited there at fearless tour, speak now tour, red tour and 1989 world tour even though you are a world star. Taylor Swift I love you very much and I'm a big fan but I'm a little disappointed that you do not visit many countries. I'm from Sweden and you have never visited Sweden either, so I didn't get the chance to see you because I can not afford to fly to the United States and see you live there.
Taylor I hope that in the future you will visit more countries so that I and other swifties get the chance to see you live or even meet you (which is my biggest dream)
