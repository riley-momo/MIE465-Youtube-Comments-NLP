I think that you are very genuine with evrything that you do..you are proud whether you had enhancements or other flaws. I really love your personality and videos are informative and really fun to watch. Im binge watching all of them..",0.9896,153

Ok guys so here are some of the trends I feel need to be dead and buried in 2017.My Apologies for the use of the word triggered for those of you who are offended. in no way do i want to make light of metal illness having dealt with it on a personal level. However my use of the word triggered was in reference to 'take action' based on being impacted by this video rather then anything to do with mental instability! keeping it light hearted and happy.,-0.6476,94
