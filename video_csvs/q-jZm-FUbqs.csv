"Kinda disappointed because it was clear as a day that they will give the win to Asuka or whatever her name is. It was scripted AF in the end, the Bellas eleminating The Boss and then Nikki 'turning heel' to her sister. They all could've eliminated Asuka and then figure it out, but it that was the case,the Bella's could've elimnated Sasha and it's known that Nikki is stronger, so she'd win but they didn't want to give Nikki the win, so they scripted things to the point she's in second place. I think she deserves better, she easily could've won, coming 27 and if this wasn't SO DAMN SCRIPTED. Yes, Asuka is indeed athletic and powerful, but I don't really like her. If not Nikki Bella, other women very much deserved to win. Sasha deserved winning as well. But not Asuka in my eyes. She's not likeable, she doesn't do promos. She's annoying and not interesting tbh.",0.9921,182

Quit bitching and making emphasis on your gender it's so annoying its always women who can get away with this and no one has a problem if i was a woman i wouldn't make any excuses for anything i got or worked for same with race look at interviews with booker t or ron simmons teddy long they were in the early years when it was harder for them and they made no excuses and always said it was never a race thing that kept them from achieving or thinking it would stop them nor did they ever take pride in it they just did what they wanted. This whole women's wrestling emphasis just seems like some cliche baby face boasting i get that it makes the company look good in a Political correct way and brain washes all the female fans but give it a rest already.,-0.467,150
