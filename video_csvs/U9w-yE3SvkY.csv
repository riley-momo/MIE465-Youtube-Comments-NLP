"I get you had to kill off a character to keep people interested but killing Carl (imo) destroyed any future for genuine continuation of the series. It would have been clean for Rick to die and Carl to take over. Boom, young star to carry the franchise who's been here from the beginning. But now with him gone, it's really just a showdown between Rick and Negan and the storyline continues. Idk...questionable decision imo and I think it spells the end for TWD within a season or two.",-0.9451,99

My condolences to those of you who gave the show a second, third, or forth chance after all the fan bashing’s dealt up. I’m sure the actors feel blessed to have worked on a show that had such high prospects and viewership, but they deserved better writers. 

Free word of advice AMC. Don’t lose Lauren Cohan and get some quality writers.",0.8338,111
I think the thing that gets me is chandler didn't want to go he was told they wanted to do another 3 year contract and then fired him just before his 18th birthday. So when he does this emotional scene it's just as emotional for him,-0.323,47

Ha Ha Ha!! Way to off an individual who was supposed to be a main character of the show. So poorly written. Oh, and his, ""Can't everybody just, get along"", speech he gives at the end was even lamer. 
And the show continues, like Carl was never apart of it. Oh, this show is o bad. It ruined zombie flicks for the next twenty years. Please let it end soon. Seems like all the actors who want to have a career outside of this shit show are jumping ship.
