"Chris Radovan I understand her lack of experience but I can't accept her inability to grow with the massive resources at her disposal (compared to other women national teams). 

Although my heart goes for the team, I am always attempted to rally for the opposing team on the basis of technique and finese on the ball. It makes me sad. I mean very sad. Sorry to bother you with my grievances on this issue. I feel sad for young talents like Pugh who may not realise their full if this trend persists into the future. Good to have such an insightful discussion. Thanks",-0.7396,113

"Heath maybe but Dunn I can’t see how she makes the team stronger.  She is not a dominant defender nor is she dominant offensively.  Yes she scored 4 goals against Russia but her overall performance in 2017 was not all that good to begin with. Scoring against. Russia is far easier than scoring against teams like France, Canada etc",0.6306,66
"I agree that the team is good but improvements are needed. Other countries have made tremendous improvements and the gap is closing. I think this makes the games exciting to watch but the outcome can be disappointing. Our style of play is stagnant which makes it very readable by other teams.US soccer puts about 20 million dollars a year in to women/girls soccer. More money than any other country. We also have at least 4X's the player pool than any other nation which I believe will makes us have the strongest bench during world tournament play. I think our bench players have always given us an added advantage.Although I was terribly disappointed with the teams losses, I am not sure how they could have been avoided. If they had played lower ranked teams I believe they would have been good enough to win. She also could have included more experienced players on the roster.I did not agree with Jill's tactics at the time because the team  was left overly vulnerable.My understanding is her focus was not on trying to put together a team that can win in 2017.Her vision is to put a team together that can win in 2019. I don't like this tactic but I do understand it.",0.976,227
I didn't say the did not have enough players to win the cup. I said they had very few top players. Few means 3 and you mentioned their names. My intension was not to knock the team but to applaud them for their exceptional team ball play. They played exceptionally well.When I said stagnant I was not referring to how they play during a game.  It was in reference to their historical style of play. I can see they are trying to  transforming to skill and speed players now. I just think this transition could have been and needed to be implemented sooner. I am a fan and dedicated support of the USWNT and I also think it possible to both support the team and   critique their play.Hopefully this clears things up.,0.9856,141
"I do understand that her feet were extremely sore and that she simply couldn't resist undoing her footwear immediately. However, all her team members also had very sore feet but none of them removed their boots because they had the pride and dignity to refrain from doing so in front of their fans! I'm sure the very attractive Alex Morgan also had very sore feet after that but she needed to maintain her good image. Of all people, Christen Press the very cute one couldn't care less, and that is why I'm disappointed at her.",0.8554,102

"Maharajkumar Swamidoss please even with the above mentioned names the team is still weak. Since the departure of Pia, I have not witnessed any solid improvement in any department of the game for the American team. The lack of imagination on the part of the current coaching team was revealed with the departure of seven prominent players after the World Cup. Jill has to take a critical look at her strategy and tactics going forward. She has been fortunate with most teams also undergoing rebuilding exercise. I get frustrated when she uses her experimentation plan as an excuse for awful performances.  Yes I don't expect the team to win all the time, but I expect some improvements in certain areas of the game for the team by now. It has been more than two years now if I am wrong.",0.3459,150

To you bhleong, I would suggest that please trust these players's judgement about their own bodies. These are world class players. If she removed her shoes there must have been some very valid reason. And none of us, not you, not me, none of the other commentators here, has real knowledge of what happened. Give the player benefit of the doubt: I mean trust their judgement. We are not on the field. We are not working as hard as they do for 90 straight minutes. ( not counting any of the practice time). Let not such a very small thing ruin your image of any of them. They are lovely, they are strong, they are beautiful, they are intelligent, and above all they are among the BEST in the world. Let us love them, support them, encourage them......",0.9927,179
"Sorry for my misunderstood. I agreed with Jill on the idea of rebuilding the team. Do you see Jill switched Press to right wing forward for this game. she used to play as center forward. she can dribble and quick release shot to score goal. It is good to try and see how player fit in. Most of the foreign teams are moving to speed and skill and physical player like French, Netherland, England, Denmark,Spain. if you want to bring back WC or O cup, you have to rebuild your team in that way. Dunn was OK with her speed and and skill but she little bit small. She is still on the team but Her club did not want to release her for this game. I think if you want to win the game, your defensive backs need to have the speed and be able to defense  one on one. USWNT had a loaded good midfield and forward players but the back was lack of speed and skill. That was the reason she tried to rebuild it. That was my opinion.",0.9389,203
"Sorry. I did not mean that youth national teams are technically better than senior national teams. I believe that the young players who are brought on to the senior side come in with a higher level of technical abilities.I watched the 2017 games and I was left extremely worried too. So I do understand that. As time went on I realized that if they chose to play the top 10 teams during this period of transition that losing games was a reasonable outcome. I  do hate it when they lose but the other teams were able to capitalize on our weaknesses during this transitional period .I do agree that their winning attitude and character is doubtful at the moment. I don't think I can fault them for this because the team is not set yet. The new players are there to try out for the team. Going forward I do believe that once the positions have been established, attitude and character will evolve. North Korea, South Korea and I think China train their youth teams on a completely different level than we do ( to my understanding). Our youth national teams meet for two weeks 4-6 times a year , the rest of the time they play in soccer clubs. In contrast, North Korea, South Korea and possibly China train their youth teams in soccer schools. They receive and education and soccer training 4-5 days a week and return home on the weekend. This of course seems to be a clear advantage when it comes to youth national play. But this advantage so far has not transferred to their senior side. I don't know  why that is.So I do agree about the weaknesses that were shown. I also worry. When I look back at the dynamics(transitional team, playing in a new formation, against the best ranked teams in the world) I can see no reason why I should have expected them to win every game. I will be paying close attention to this teams evolution.If some of my previous statements came across as harsh, I apologies. It is never my intention to disagree or discuss  in a confrontational matter.",0.9215,393

"Trinh Nguyen I am about to watch the game now. However, I don't agree with your comment about the quality of players on the Canadian side. Over the past two years or so, Canada has produced better players compared to the US:  better ball control, better passers of the ball and better coordination. What the Canadian side lacks is self confidence and character to win which is an attribute most American teams tend to have in abundance. Additionally, the Canadian side lack endurance, a trait which has helped US to dominate in women soccer for a long time. If US took charge of the game after the 70th minute, that is expected. Canada vs US has always been similar to France vs US until the she believes Cup. Most of women's team I have watched since 1995 lack character and endurance except for The US team. This makes it difficult for most teams to beat them consistently on any given day. But as the game improves and develops, US has to add more arsenals to the team to maintain its dominance.",0.9272,199
"Trinh Nguyen.  Canada has had several top players besides Sinclair. Diane Matheson, Sophie Schmidt ,Desiree Scott and the formidable Melissa Tancredi. I think that Erin McLeod is one of the top goalkeepers in the women's game.Although the USWNT have some top players that doesn't necessarily equate to having the best team. In the 2017 Euro's the winning team had very few ""top players"" but they had the best team.. So for me it's not who has the better players but who has the better team.I think the point that Vim O is correct. The USWNT level of play has been stagnant and needs to evolve.",0.975,118

Remember US vs Sweden game 2016!!!!.  That is why she had to test with 10 ranking teams and find a solution. It better to lose in friendly cup than WC or O. I don't think Pia is better than Jill. She is new, Time will tells.",0.8679,57
"Vim O
You know that most of Canada players were play for Us WNSL. How many of them stay at the top of the players . Most of the top players were Europe  and US. According to my knowledge,  Canada had only Sinclair.  US still have a lot of players better than Canada national team roster players in the WNSL but couldn't make the team because of competition. The young and skillful players like Pugh, Rose, Chioma, just give them a year or two. The only one problem that USWNT didn't have a good goal keeper. If Jill can find one, I think Canada very hard to beat US even in a good day with the good players.",-0.8029,130
"Vim O. I have to agree that Canada has produce  better quality of players but only compared to previous Canadian players. Our youth national team produce better technical players than the previous American players. Our youth national teams consistently beat the Canadian youth national teams. The Canadian U-20 national team did defeat our U-18 team but that is to be expected. I am not sure their youth players are technically better than our youth players. All youth players are technical better than most players on the senior national teams.Regarding your comment about watching teams  since 1995 and the reason the US has been dominate is because other teams lack character and endurance. Other national teams have had 22 years to work on this so I have to think it must be more than this. It's not really about lacking endurance it's about lacking possession of the ball.If you spend a majority of the game chasing the ball it drains you mentally and physically.I think the US lost 11 players from the 2015 world cup team. I believe that all of them were world class players.During this rebuilding process I am not sure why people didn't expect that some of the top 10 teams wouldn't beat us. I am sure that if Jill chose to play lower ranking teams during this process we would have won. This was a good time for them to beat the US. They all had a better quality team. We had revolving players trying out for  positions on the team.I think this process is about adding more ""arsenal"" to the team. She just decided try and add this arsenal while playing the top 10 Fifa ranked teams. They lost 3 games.",0.9322,311
"Vim O. If winning continually does not indicate or equate to a team having better players, what does winning continuously  indicate or equate to ?The US tends to maintain possession against most teams.Playing a better style of game is nice to watch but so far that type of play plus aggressiveness and playing on their home tuff has only won one  tournament. EURO 2017. They were patient and precise. It hasn't helped France nor Brazil but I do enjoy watching them play.I think the Canadian coach has a great understanding of the game . I am not sure about the team because they are coached continuously for 90 min. I am not sure why that is.After the 2016 Olympics Jill said she realized she did not have the players who had the technical abilities to break down a bunker defense.  But a bunker defense is difficult to break down. France could not break Portugal's bunker defense in the 2016 EURO.The US at the time did have many one dimensional players and I think Jill is looking at younger players who have better technical abilities which might help with bunker type defense.Canada has a lot of young, some as young as 16, players who are technically better than the older Canadians players. They are also technically better than the older US players. Our youth players are technically better than our older players and are technically better than the older Canadian players.I don't think their young players are technically better than our young players. I do think that all younger players are technically better than all older players.I don't know of any Canadian player who's been on the Fifa worlds best 11.I do think that Christine Sinclair is one of the greatest footballers in the history of the women's game.",0.997,321
"We deserved what we got. We started to play loose with the ball when it was only a tie. Fleming is going to be a star, but she was reckless with the ball near our own net. USA just showed us why they are still the best in the world.",0.5106,55
"You have to understand Jill has no experience in doing what she is currently doing particularly at this level everything she is doing now is a first time at this level She spent a lot of years as a collegiate coach but never been a coach at any higher level unless you count the 2014-2015  USWNT Coaching job or even U-20 and U-21 team she coach which again is pretty much collegiate. Look at what she has done to date, tried a 3 person defensive line which did not go over well, tries Allie long at defense a bad move, put an Olympic team together that included injured player (Rapinoe)  who was not fit nor even physical ready to even play one full game instead of one that was game ready and fit to play?   Would she succeed in the NWSL as a head coach??",-0.6829,158

"artdog4u , i agree. Winning is not always the ultimate measuring stick. Sometime luck plays a role. Win or lose, US ia still the best, but  Canada looks like has a good future if they keep improving. Also, all players are SO young. When they mature, they will be a formidable force.",0.9723,63
"artdog4u Please I am not offended by anything statement you have made. I really love the discussion. I just wanted you to know that the team is good but not getting better. 

I really appreciate your insightful observations. Probably, my expectations are too high and a bit biased with my personal involvement in the game at various levels. 

I know the team is in transition. However Jill has been around for awhile to at least know and understand some of the old players. I hope things work out for the best. 

The way the transition period has been handled leaves more room for doubt and uncertainty which I thought was avoidable. I hope 2018 will be a year of substantial progress. Thank you and lovely to hear from you again",0.98,142
"artdog4u When our winning of games does not significantly commensurate with significant improvement in our understanding of game as well as our technical capabilities, I get worried. It means that others can easily catch up.

If you go back and watch the games we lost in 2017, you will understand what I am trying to say. And even some of matches we worn, the opposition could easily break our defense. For me, things may not be great going forward as other countries are beginning to take the women's game seriously and fund it like we do (For example Australia who in time past was just an addition to the game has become  comparative exciting to watch). 

National youth teams being better technically than  the senior national teams is not true in any context of the statement. There may be a few youthful players with the potential to become better. 

Since 2008/9, our youth teams have not measured up to other youth teams in world tournaments. North and South Korea to the best of my knowledge excel in terms of technically gifted players at that level. I am not very familiar with the Canadian youth teams and as such I am ill-equipped to comment on them. It is what I have seen with passage of time at the senior side that I am commenting on. 

We may disagree in some areas, but one attribute of our team which makes them better at the world stage is it's winning attitude with character. 

That winning attitude with character is doubtful at the moment as Jill seeks to constitute a new team. You may not see the weaknesses I am trying to highlight but I hope the coaching staff does see it and work on it appropriately going forward. 
Thanks for education and the discussion, I highly appreciate that.",0.9902,330
"artdog4u You have some made some good points. However, winning continually does not indicate or equate to a team having better players. For example, Brazil and France always parade high quality individual players for most tournaments but fail to deliver when it matters most. 

Our team does not play a possession type of game most of the time because we do not have that technical ability. We tend to have much possession when we play against very weak teams. Since the 1990's, we have had  to rely on long balls and play a very physical game to win. 

When Pia came in as the new coach, her key struggle was determining the new factor that would turn our team into a total dominating one in every aspect of the game. Thankfully, she excelled in so many areas except for possession. 

We literally can not boast of a great player maker. My point is this: Canada in recent years play a better game than the US. Their players seem to demonstrate a better understanding of the game with most of the attacks they initiate. Their movement from defense into attack since 2012 for me is something delightful to watch.

 Nonetheless, I am not sure of what you mean by the statement ""we have better players"". If it is in terms of winning then I do agree. However, on techniques/technicalities, I don't think so. 

We tend to have a lot of one dimensional players (they are still exciting to watch) which for women soccer is not much of a problem if you play to your strength and minimize your mistakes. 

Side note: let's get an operational definition of what we mean by a quality player and I believe we can make ahead way with our discussion. It is always good to know the views of other fans of the game. Great discussion and a lovely response. Thank you.",0.9879,355
artdog4u.  The Euro's winning team had Martens Lieke ( Messi women's Football) and two best strikers Miedema Viviane and Van De dander. Euro people compared Miedema Viviane  as CR7. You didn't think they had enough players to win the cup?. Alex sanchez and Messi were also great players of soccer but you can't put them in the same level. USWNT is transforming to skill and speed players. I think It will take them a year or two. I did not see any stagnant in the second game vs Canada.,0.8151,100
