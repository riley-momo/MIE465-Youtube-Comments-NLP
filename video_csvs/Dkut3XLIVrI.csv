"LYRICS:

Spill all your emotions on the table
And let me see your heart upon your sleeve
Open up your soul, I wanna know exactly what you need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

I know that I got this thing upon me
I don't need more expensive nonessential things
Cause when I kiss your lips, the feels I get, is everything I need
So tell me all you want for Christmas is me

So I'm gonna love you like, like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

This time of year we always get distracted
Trying to fill up all the space under the tree
So lets take 'em back and know exactly what we really need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

So I'm gonna love you like, like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas is me
 
You don't need to worry baby
Cause I'm right here by you
And everyday would drive me crazy if I lost you

So I'm gonna love you like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want for Christmas
Say all you want is me",0.9371,281

[Verse 1: Shania Twain]
Spill all your emotions on the table
And let me see your heart upon your sleeve
Open up your soul, I wanna know exactly what you need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

[Verse 2: Nick Jonas]
I know that I got this thing upon me
I don't need more expensive nonessential things
Cause when I kiss your lips, the feels I get, is everything I need
So tell me all you want for Christmas is me

[Chorus: Nick Jonas & Shania Twain]
So I'm gonna love you like, like it's always Christmas Eve
I'm gonna sacrifice the selfish part of me
Cause when we're all alone and I hold you close
It's everything I need
Say all you want for Christmas is me

This time of year we always get distracted
Trying to fill up all the space under the tree
