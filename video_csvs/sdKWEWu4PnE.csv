"I'm not ANTI-Roman like a lot of people seem to be, but I'm beyond ECSTATIC that Mr. Nakamura got the win !!! So freakin' cool !!!!!! Kinda sad that Ruby Riott didn't get to win the inaugural Women's Rumble match (Yeah, Ruby Riott's kinda my crush I admit.), but even that was a cool match. Great to see some legends return. The coolest mark-out moments for me were Lita, Rey Mysterio, Michelle McCool and - I know I'll get flack for this, but it was cool to see Kelly Kelly. The face-off between Beth Phoenix and Nia Jaxx, I was like ""Oh crap, a blood-bath is gonna happen now !!!"". That was intense !!!!",0.9788,141
