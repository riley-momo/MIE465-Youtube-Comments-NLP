"Here's my theory.  It wasn't promoted on music shows so when people don't have that extra incentive of helping them get a win, they don't stream as much.  And also it's a ballad.  And unfortunately, even though it's an epic, gorgeous ballad....it's tougher for ballads to get big numbers.",0.858,58

"The Audrey Hepburn shirt Jun wears in Mansae yes he's still part of EXO, but because of korea-china politics isnt good last year he couldn't make it to last year comeback. And if anyone ask why other chinese members of other groups still can promote in Korea is because they don't have solo promotion in china, and also Lay is really someone important in his country and he also promote or something like that related to gov( I forgot about what), so he can't join the comeback. We still hope he can join this year comeback because I heard the politic isssue is quickly resolved, but still don't know whether his schedule in China already packed for long time period or not",0.8969,130

"우리가 감동한것은 GO에서 세훈이 목소리 들을수 이서예요 다른것이 아니라 
الشيء الذي يؤثر فينا هو صوتك، لا شيء اخر.
세훈이 무대 만으로 감사하고 행복해요
انا سعيدة وراضية فقط بسبب اداءات سيهون المُنفردة
세훈이 항상 사랑하고 응원입니다
سيهوني نحن نحبك كثيراً وسندعمك طوال الوقت
천사 세훈 항상 행복해요
الملاك سيهون ارجوك كُن سعيداً دائماً
난 항상 응원할게요
سأدعمك دائماً
푹 쉬세요
ارجوك ارتح جيداً
항상 팬들을 위해 노력해주는 세훈이 마음 너무 고마워요
