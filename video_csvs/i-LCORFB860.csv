А летать вслепую на высоких скоростях с полным салоном людей - не лучшая перспектива для пилота. Рейс пришлось бы прервать.

"Михал Михалыч не стоит. В целом самолёты не должны быть повреждены, поскольку они насквозь пропускаю разряд по обшивке, а салон изолирован. Но всё же такой вольтаж может навредить датчикам и системам связи(сбить их показания и нарушить работу). Было бы обидно, если бы во время продолжительного рейса в самолёте отключились системы навигации и все магнитные датчики - ведь так появляется погрешномть в траектории полёта. Проще говоря, можно прилететь не туда. А топливо не бесконечное, и время туристов тоже. Хотя зрелище действительно впечатляет.",0.0,96
"На 0:49 получился ракурс сверху-сзади и стали заметны голова, крылья и хвост птицы...
Хотя аэродромные службы должны держать на службе стаю соколов и иметь другие меры по недопущению полётов птиц...   Потом на 1:09... ещё стая птиц до 10 штук пролетает поблизи  оператора не в фокусе, очертания размыты но взмахи крыльев можно заметить...",0.0,58

"Спасибо, Inter Net, посмеялся. Но верить таким новостям, уж простите, это совершенно не серьёзно. В мире происходит много странных и необъяснимых вещей, ещё не доказанных наукой, но это лишь дело времени. Однако это не тот случай, где требуются научные изыскания, здесь нужно просто ""включить"" мозг, подумать рационально и логически, и тогда ни на какую абсурдную мистификацию не останется места. Хотя я не принуждаю людей отказаться верить в то, во что они хотят верить,... это их право, пусть верят хоть в НЛО, хоть в чёрта лысого. Я лишь пытаюсь донести до людей здравомыслящих, что в данном случае нет абсолютно ничего странного, что выбивалось бы за рамки разумного.",0.0,131
