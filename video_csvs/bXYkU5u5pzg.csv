"Do you need to make $$ working from anywhere with internet access? If so this is for you.

The opportunity I am about to share with you is a true “NO COST” type that you can work on your computer, tablet or cell phone. This allows you to work it from anywhere as long as you have internet and or a wifi connection. It took me approximately 15-minutes to sign-up on both sites.

I must admit I was a bit skeptical at first but, that changed about 45 minutes later when my earnings hit $65.00 on one site and $40.00 on the other. This gave me a total of $95.00 in about an hour. Within a couple hours, I had over $185.00 in my account. Now, it is (3) days later and my accounts together are over $365.00. All this from posting my links listed below.

You may be wondering by now what this opportunity entails so, here it is. The opportunity is advertising, for which you are paid to do. “You are Not Asked to Purchase Anything” and the money earned is a referral/sharing fee for you. I recommend that you create a separate email address to use with this opportunity to keep it separate from your main email.  

Note: When I signed up I was given an automatic credit of $15.00 in one account and $25.00 in the other.

9 Not of works, lest any man should boast.

Romans 10:9(KJV) - That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.

Matthew 24:11 - 13(KJV)

My testimony

GOD Said

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
1John 2:4
