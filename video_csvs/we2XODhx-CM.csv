Also keep in mind, we also evolved culturally without needing to get rid of marraige. We merely evolved what a marraige means and what goes into a marraige.",-0.9595,108

"How is someone suppose to expand their perception if they've only been shown one perspective? For example, a person is not going to think that childless unmarried women are more than just bitter man-children when that's all they've been exposed to. You can't tell people to ""educate themselves"" if you don't direct them. What do you mean ""for it to become more acceptable""? No one in the West thinks it's acceptable forcing women to be housewives. We're just saying that being a promiscuous childless spinster probably isn't the best alternative.

""The marriage & child bearing thing is such a deeply conditioned phenomenon""
because child-bearing is due to evolution.Humanity wouldn't have survived for thousands of years if no one wanted babies.  Also, marriage has been the best way to raise children. You don't HAVE to get married, but being a single mom isn't a very good alternative.

""we just blindly do these things""
No, we do these things because they're optimal and part of evolution. That's like saying most people are straight because of conditioning.",-0.6549,197

"I totally understand what you're saying about seeing life through the filter of our own experiences. The problem lies within this whole society. For example education for us is just based on being able to find work one day, so education mostly helps us to earn money. Just imagine if education was centered on the individual, on the human being..helping us understand our emotions, work on them & overcome them, teaching us about our true self, the purpose of life, why we are really here etc. But this will not never happen if the majority does not question anything and just goes on living like everyone always has..just bringing about huge technological & material changes is not what make us civilised or intelligent. 

Mating, child bearing is an instinctual thing & instinct is something to be transcended if we want to go higher on the evolution ladder. 

Civil marriage is quite a recent thing and I can tell u that signing a contract goes against the very nature of our soul. I don't know for others but I don't consider myself as an object or the private property of anyone to go & sign a contract..and it goes the other way as well..no one belongs to me. Signing a contract with another human being sends a mental & emotional message to our subconscious mind.. that we own that person. That's why some people kill their spouses if they want a divorce or is seeing some else.

Marriage is the best way to raise children? Really? Then we should have so many mentally, emotionally & spiritually healthy individuals walking the surface of this earth. Then why are there so many wars, so much corruption, so much sexual assault, so much mental verbal abuse, so much inequality, so much harm being caused to this planet..these things are caused by us humans, aren't they? Most of us have been raised in marriages, then what's the problem? The problem is simply our low level of consciousness..when you get 2 unconscious people getting married, you cannot expect anything great to come out of it..those who can objectively observe people/society will definitely see it.",-0.9829,407

This is why she had him murdered.. Lies by not only a huge lying war monger Hillary, but the mainstream media her stupid husband had deregulated from 50 companies down to only 6 owner PERIOD that own all the news, radio and newspaper and magazines you read which are full of shit and highly propagandized.. so there ya go.. Miss smarty pants and her sick obsession w/Hillary, along w/all of the other idiot hypocrites in Hollywood are disgusting .....She is a psycho war monger and frankly all these Hollywood assholes who claim they're liberals and said Hillary would be some kind of savior are either mentally fucked in the head, aka Chelsea Handler who is NOT funny, not an actress, frankly has no talent as I have watched her so-called  comedy special and it was NOT funny and neither are her books..She's always been a huge question mark as I NEVER understood how this nobody from nowhere got to have any kind of talk show when she is truly a bitch on her show..Isn't funny, isn't educated and then I found out how this all happened..She slept w/the head of E for 5 full years  where she had this talk show that never made sense.I would watch this here and there and think WTF?? Her, really?? I don't get it..she's not funny..and she's truly a bitch and a drunk and a druggie....if this is supposed to be what female empowerment is supposed to be about, I couldn't be happier to see her show go down in flames..She added nothing to anything and still doesn't..She's not a leader, she's a follower and she's also a liar.. So tell us again Chelsea how you quit to become some kind of political activist because that is quite funny and a LIE... If she's supposed to be the figure of female empowerment or especially that lying JOKE named Hillary, I will gladly back off because neither of these women constitute female empowerment of any kind..if anything they oppress women.. Way to go loser.........Trump sucks, but Hillary is NO better than him and has a proven history record of pure shit..

IF YOU LOVE ME KEEP MY COMMANDMENTS
JOHN 14:15

^ new testament verse, for the stubborn

GOD Said

HE THAT SAITH I KNOW HIM AND KEEPETH NOT HIS COMMANDMENTS IS A LIAR AND TRUTH IS NOT IN HIM.

^new testament verse, for the stubborn 

GOD SAID 

BLESSED ARE THEY THAT DO HIS COMMANDMENTS, THAT THEY MAY HAVE RIGHT TO THE TREE OF LIFE, AND MAY ENTER IN THROUGH THE GATES INTO THE CITY
REVELATION 22:14

^ new testament verse for the stubborn 

SO WHENEVER SOMEONE COMES AND TELLS ME ,
YOU DONT HAVE TO FOLLOW COMMANDMENTS EVEN THOUGH I TOLD YOU HE CAME AND TOLD ME WE DO!!! TO MAKE THE RAPTURE 

ALL I HEAR IS THIS PERSON IS A LIAR , THIS PERSON DOES NOT KNOW THE LORD, THIS PERSON DOES NOT LOVE GOD .THE TRUTH IN NOT IN THIS PERSON !!!
THIS PERSON IS NOT GOING TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIS GATES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
To be ready for God's arrival. Don't forget to sing in your head or aloud ""holy water in God's hands"" song angel showed me, cup hands in water   so that it baptises you in the holy spirit. Holy is longated 3 counts. Shows physical and spiritual commitment to God reborn to walk in his way of obedience to his Law, commandments and daily repentance! children also 💞John 3:1-21
He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.
