Thirdly, I was re-watching a video of yours (Your: what a ""get ready with me"" video should really look like) And I couldn't help but notice that we look..... a whole lot alike when you don't have make-up on. (I am also pale AF and one of the Eyebrowless. Granted, I think I'm younger than you and I might be some un-named pounds heavier.) We're practically twinsies!
