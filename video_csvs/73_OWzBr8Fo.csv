I relate in so many ways. I'm also from Miami and my mother traveled overseas to make a better life for herself. I 100% relate to the shyness of singing in front of people!

"This is so relatable... I love music and Taylor Swift, i want to be a singer when I grow up, but um just too shy... I don't sing in front of anyone. I usually blast music in my room and sing my heart out, but as soon as someone opens the door, I pretend to lose interest. I don't know why I just never have enough confidence in myself. How do you manage to sing in front to so many people? I don't even want to sing in my choir group!😳",0.0844,103
