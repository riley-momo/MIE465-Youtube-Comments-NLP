Puerto Rico 😭💔
My younger sister Iris and my dear twin nieces were nearly swept away in the raging waters and winds that pounded the beautiful island and it people September 20th. I nearly lost part of my dear family there. They were finally able to contact me about three weeks later with a borrowed mobile phone. They had been rescued and in a homeless shelter. They lost nearly everything.
Thank you God for saving them and many others.
My heart goes out to the families who lost loved ones.
Thank you to all the helpers, responders and people who now still help Puerto Rico.
