Ok. So another coming of age movies for women over forty! I'd like to see a movie where she actually doesn't play someone who wins over the crowd by being a closet nympho breaking out! Great mom role to play when young women need their moms the most. Life lesson compete with your daughters for men when you get older. This is so wrong in many ways. It's true I used to laugh at movies like this but recently I'm wondering who the hell feelings it's more compelling to write over done garbage like this. Really Hollywood proves again they have no idea what the rest of country thinks anymore. Melissa needs to break free of roles like this because she is a talented woman with more in her than this garbage.,0.9455,141
