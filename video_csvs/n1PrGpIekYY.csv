That's right. Call me bad names because your argument is wrong. You can say it all you want but it doesn't make it right. Niall LEGALLY cannot block the video on YT. He gave them permission to use it and there is a contract. He has no control over who they do and do not show it to unless he BREAKS the contract and pulls the whole video off of their platform. He obviously did not do that because it is still able to be viewed in other countries. That leaves YT AND the countries that are blocked the ONLY ones who could be  responsible for the reason why it cannot be viewed there. I worked in licensing for my local TV station and dealt with the contracts with YT and our stations videos that were posted there. What you are implying is incorrect and not legal.,-0.2838,157

"To the people who is saying Niall need to apologize and the heat in 1:08 looks like the rising sun flag:
Don't make a storm in a glass. Niall didn't diss nobody, he's not promoting the flag or something like that, it supposed to be a scene where the eyes spread heat, it's a coincidence.
The people know history and know the flag, is not like we don't care but complain about this it's like the girl who was complaining with Starbucks because she thougth the cream in her coffee looked like a svastica. You're overreacting.",0.842,105
Uneducated Westerners!! Your country has ruined my country. But why should We be quiet? Your country was an imperialist state. Let's start here. We both agree that Niall Horan is a racist and using a war criminal flag. 🖕🏻🖕🏻He blocked all Asian IP🖕🏻🖕🏻,-0.9391,58

"You were the one who threw around the word ""racist"" first. Also, a little YT education. Niall licensed his video to YT. At that point they are in control of who views it. The only way Niall can restrict it at that point is to pull the whole thing. So, accusing him is a falsehood. More than likely YT blocked it or your county did. What does it matter? You were offended, it was blocked so you didn't have to see it anymore. You obviously changed you IP so you could come here and spread hate and misinformation.",-0.9286,113
You're right. It may not represent Rising sun flag as you say. but what I want to say is the attitude of foreigners who made fun of and cursed Koreans for their sensitivity in this situation that they could have misunderstood. It was also hard to understand that it made the misunderstanding worse by blocking the video from being viewed without sufficient feedback,-0.8765,66

"i don't care what the design was intended to do. The important thing is that the design reminds us of the rising sun, and even when we look at it objectively, the two designs are very similar. i'm not sure if you already know but they used when they were invading other countries. http://english.anti-risingsunflag.net/ i guess this could help your understanding. 
I expect you do not use 卍 because it reminds Hakenkreuz. even it is a symbol of Buddha's merit or reincarnation, holiness. Please think once more before you put your finger on your keyboard. We still have so many people who are suffering with this problem. and they didn't even apologized yet. Today, one of the surviving comfort women died. now we just have 30 of them. the only thing they want is an apology. i'm just so sad that this happened today.",-0.7525,161
