"1- Self Control: Looks really bad without gloss
2- Problematic: Patchy like the berry shades in Holiday collection
3- Restraints: Too sheer and patchy

Jeffree should stick to his formula that has proven to work. Holiday collection was great (minus the patchy berry shades. WHY?). He should restock his lips with his best formula instead of pushing out new shades that are questionable.",0.912,76

His name is Jeffree lol he goes by he. Have you ever heard the word androgynous? If not look it up. He even has a eye shadow palette called the androgyny palette.

She's had a sucky enough year because of my medical crap and it's the one thing she asked for (ok, 2nd, but I gave her the other in case I died, early). Not asking for free or anything special but it's just me and her sister and that's it in this world so if there is anyway I could buy it and have it before 4/2/18 much love and gratitude. My girls adore you and I just wanna do what I can before I flip their lives. Thanks Jeffree, if you can't/won't/don't wanna that's life but it can't hurt to ask.

"So I am in love with all of your makeup products specially adrogyny since that's the only palette I own from your online cosmetics which I got from Amazon since it sold out or was out of stock maybe and I loved it and I still have it and use and it has worn down quite a bit but still has a fair amount of eyeshadow on it, and a couple days ago I went to your online cosmetics store and I saw these beautiful set of different palettes with very pigmented eyeshadow and I thought to myself if only I had the money to buy these 😂😂😢😢😢 I just stared at them and wanted them and coming from a family with money but using it for important needs rather than wants it only comes like twice a month and to me I love love love love LOVE makeup but don't own a lot of makeup products so I use hacks so I'm just here binge watching your makeup tutorials and me having to hack and substitute everything is pretty insane but I manage. So I got excited when you announced the blood sugar palette and I went on your website maybe the day after and I saw it was sold out so I was wondering when you'll be able to restock the item???
