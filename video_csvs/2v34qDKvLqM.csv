"People are nicer to blonds because of a stereotype.
In the common stereotype, light skin, hair end color of the eyes in a woman suggest that she may be sweeter, calmer, as opposed to black skin, hair and eyes, that suggested something mysterious, scary, not visible.
This in bad in both cases cause many blonds have charming alive spirit, curious vivacious and brave while many dark hair women are very sweet, sensitive and are timid in the most seductive way.

I think it's a shame that still to this very day even celebrities are not trying to be more serious about this.
