"HBO should team up with New Japan Pro Wrestling should do a documentary about wrestler/ politican Antonio Inoki. They should focus on:
-Early days obviously
-His mentor and the boom of Wrestling in Japan
-JWA days
-Rise of NJPW and Strong Style
-His MMA fight with Muhammad Ali
-His political career moments like when He successfully negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of Japanese hostages and how he gave a samurai sword to Saddam as a gift and also how he would hold wrestling events in countries like Iraq and North Korea to create better relations with Governments like the North Korean Collision in Korea supershow.

His Cadillac pulled up around back where we were sneaking in and when he got out the security back then was looking at him and wasn't paying attention to me and my buddy so we creeped in the door. We went ahead and stopped around the corner waiting for him. So here the ""GIANT"" comes and he walked to me and smiled and put his hand on my shoulder.. now I was only 15 yrs old and said to me""YOUR GOOD"". I asked him for his autograph but I didn't have anything for him to sign and the security guard told me to move aside and André looked at that guy and said ""HE IS WITH ME"" I was freaking out so we walked to his dressing room and said"" wait here"" and he came back and gave me a  signed cane and thanked me for being a fan of wrestling and went back to his dressing room. I'm not sure what happened to it but I will always remember that night and how cool and polite that he was. Thank you ""ANDRÉ"" Forever grateful to you for giving me 5 minutes of your life.

Wilt has big furry boots on in it and Andre had cowboy boots on, but you also have to remember, by that time, Andre had already been experiencing stooping of his back, by the time 1983 was out, he was probably 6'11 or a shade under 7'0.
