Poppy knows secrets: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-WW10wNG7aM&t=29

Her favorite secret is the secret of the forbidden zones: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16sJVcropuM&t=377s

My favorite Poppy video is ""Unicorn Pizza Party"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgPWTztc8Dw

The crop circle pictured on the football field symbolizes rebirth/renewal and a new era in consciousness, and is encouraging us to transcend three dimensions: https://www.facebook.com/christopher.m.meissner/posts/10100831897787498

Note the two flying saucers hovering in the foreground (flying saucer design is based on sacred geometry, btw), as well as the pretty geometric colored orbs that are reputed to be responsible for the crop designs, among other things (no, it's not the two guys with planks and rope; they've been debunked and humiliated -- see my post).

We've seen a *lot* of sacred geometry in the crop formations over the past 37 years, and it's gotten increasingly complex with each passing year. There are messages for people who are ready and want to hear them.

Poppy likes sacred geometry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2qyUe8b6hA
 
Note the pyramids. And the five leaves, the scales of justice, the Milky Way, the smiley face over the ringed planet, the scorpion, the unicorn, the musical note, and the rainbow.

Look at who's in the stands. And at the misspelling on the pennant. And the two footballs with a question mark on them.

Check out that subtle reference to ancient Aztec architecture in the squared Fibonacci sequence designs on the stadium walls. 

That '#1' foam finger in the bottom corner. The color scheme (purple is the color of spiritual enlightenment), and that ""tokens"" is in red, and ""share"" is in blue. I see a lot of purple in the stands. I see a purple goalpost.

In one of the >5,000 authentic crop formations, the message said, quite clearly: ""Expose hidden knowledge to all citizens."" ""We oppose deception.""

Poppy:

""This is a very exciting time for us. Who's 'us'? I'm Poppy, for starters. And I have in front of me a number of students who are in my classroom: those who are trying to prepare themselves for entry into heaven. Now is a very interesting time. And you could say, 'I don't believe you.' But that's not important to me. What is important to me is earth. And the son of my father is also important to me. How do you get into the kingdom of heaven? What is eternity? How do I become a disciple? Am I a disciple, or a student? If you want to visit the next level, you will have to come with me. Do you want to come with me? Are you an opponent? I hope to be of some service to you. I believe in a very short time, we'll be there. My thoughts will always be with you."" (""What is Eternity?"": https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76OBx-kF5LA)

""Do you ever think about God?""

""God is real.""

""...maybe I'm a spider. Or maybe I'm a fisherman.""

""Am I in three dimensions? Or am I in four dimensions? . . . Do you see the aliens on my legs? . . . It's me, Poppy -- I'm in a new dimension. Come visit me! Will you stay with me in this new dimension?""

""As a minority, I feel welcomed into your world.""

""What if I told you that there is a secret?""

""People, especially nowadays, are so obsessed with knowing everything. They'll have to invest their time in finding it.""

""What would it be like if you could restart? . . . What if you could reboot yourself?""

""Poppy's world is a magical place. And it's the most free part of the entire universe."" 

""I have important things to do.""

""I'm coming everywhere in the future that is near."" 

One love. It's coming. :)
