Pixel Fyxe Designers usually become known because of their pieces. Victoria is in the unique position that she was already a household name. I think she’s done pretty well to be seen as a Designer in an industry that is notoriously snobby. I know she doesn’t sketch or physically participate in the production but I’m sure she’s very hands on with her team and she does have great fashion sense. If her designs were poor or the quality wasn’t great she wouldn’t be as successful as she is. Credit where credits due. And she comes across really well.,0.9783,117
