"Niall James Horan 
Se que tu no Leerás esto y que no vale la pena escribirlo (Y SI LO LLEGAS A VER JAMÁS LE ENTENDERÁS) 
Pero sin embargo lo voy a Hacer 
Tu Eres una de mis inspiraciones para seguir Día a Día adelante y no me importa lo que la demás gente diga o piense de mi por quererte tanto 
Tu Eres PERFECTO TAL Y COMO ERES Y NO SOLO AHORA SINO SIEMPRE LO HAS SIDO, esas  personas que alguna vez te llegaron a criticar, por cualquier estupidez pero eso te Afectó y no entiendo por que, pues esas personas quisieran llegar a donde tu estas 
Los celos son una arma tan poderosa y la utilizaron en ti 
Pero tu YA ERAS PERFECTO, me encantan tus Ojos, Tu Cabello, Tu Voz, Tu Forma de Ser y Y Todito Tu 

Te amo mucho, te valoro y te admiro 
Pues espero que algún día mi sueño de poderte conocer se pueda hacer realidad 

Y de poder ver esa Hermosa Sonrisa que yo Sueño ver en persona 
Pues nada me haría mas Feliz que verte sonreír 😍

Sigue adelante y que nadie te detenga, sigue tu sueño 

Y estoy muy orgullosa de ti por que Mira Hasta Donde Has llegado 
Y yo le agradezco a Todas Las Directioners Por Siempre estar con el y con todos los Chicos 
Tal vez no llege desde el  principio pero me quedaré hasta el Final 
Ellos No Prometieron Regresar Y Yo Les Prometo Quedarme Con Ellos Para Siempre

"Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone
And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?
Someone's moving outside
The lights come on down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?
And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don't it feel fucked up we're not in love
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
And tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
That's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
That's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
That's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?",0.986,307
