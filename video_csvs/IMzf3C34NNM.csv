"*This is going to be a long one but this might look cute and happy but when one of my children was a baby she was in a special care unit and she had a rare form of  baby 6 wk dermatitis and she looked like she was burnt from head to toe and had an arched cage over her to support her sheets as nothing cud touch her skin and she lay on an open nappy she also had to be bathed in special emolients and had a different cream for each part of her body parts, i stayed there and did it all as i was trained by the special care unit and my little girl slept all through the night till 7, i decided to go home one night to get a change of clothes and was back before 7, but came back to my baby in tears in pain and as she was before healing and her skin was no longer sore she was now back to square 1 all because a helper there saw i wasnt in the room and she decided to start bathing and doin my babys creams and she had no idea what she was doing and put the wrong creams on the wrong parts and washed her in baby wash and also also gave her the wrong feed which she was alergic to, i was fuming and the doctorts were sent for and even they said to the nursing staff why would you let a untrained helper near this baby when her mum has done it from day 1? From that day i put notices up on the door, over her bed, over the sink and all over her display window and the walls saying no one was to touch my baby not even to cuddle and not to feed or bathe her and all treatments  and feeds were done by her mother and arranged by the doctors and staff and no helpers allowed in this room, i think all mothers should only trust their own family or friends, but every time my baby slept and i went to the cafe with out fail a helper would be lingering around by my babys room and i just told them dont enter the room only doctors and nursing staff were allowed, i think helpers just have nothing better to do sometimes when they should be asking the nursing staff what help would they like them to do not stand round all day waiting for a baby to snuffle or cry, so i would never want a helper holding my baby and breaking my maternal bond between myself and my new baby, thats my job, and yes some babies have no one as the baby in the next room to mine his name was darren he was 5 mnths old and was only tere as his mother had abanded him and he woke all night for a feed which i gladly did  and i also cradled him through the day on and off as my baby was sedated he was a very goid loving cute little boy and it made so sad he was alone but was on the foster list and getting a foster family soon, but the helpers could of played with him all day but they only wanted to hold the new babies just like the day the helper done my baby she could of easily of walked into baby darrens room he was there standing up in his cot waiting for anyone to give him his breakfast and bottle and change his nappy which i did always otherwise he would of happily waited for over an hour just playing in his crib, so i ssy no to helper, and you dont know there background really*",0.9927,654

Who gave this thumbs down? This happened to my nephew as he was born early. My sister was always at the hospital but could not be there 24/7 and the baby was in small shared room so spending the night after the first 2 weeks wasn't an option. He was there 2-3 months. He is 2 now and will not stop with the pacifier- I believe he used it to sooth himself for those hours of months he was alone (none of her other kids ever wanted pacifiers).,0.4464,96
