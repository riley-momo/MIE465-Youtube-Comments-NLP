"*Armageddon* is about 4 Major Events. The White Horse with the Bow is a white missile, that NASA will SEND up.
The Red Horse with a Great Sword is the STRIKING moment of Impact.
The Black Horse with the Scales is the Rock SPLITTING into 2 pieces.
The Yellow Horse with Fire is the SEARING effect from what happens when 1 of those pieces hit the ""Fire Plate"" near Indonesia and thus tipping up and down the Fire Plate and causing a pumping motion of Lava to shoot up to the skies because of it. It's when it falls you need to worry about.

Symbol. A Pot. 
Eze 24:4 Gather the pieces thereof into it, even every good piece, the thigh, and the shoulder; fill it with the choice bones.
Eze 24:5 Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them see the bones of it therein.
(No sinews. No flesh. Unlearned. Biblical illiterate. Ezekiel 37. The good old boys and girls. )

Eze 24:6 Wherefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall upon it.
(A copper pot! Unfit to be called Jerusalem. Revelation 11:8. Perverted. No peace of mind. )
Eze 24:7 For her blood is in the midst of her; she set it upon the top of a rock; she poured it not upon the ground, to cover it with dust;
(Blood is life of the soul. Leviticus 17:11. )
Eze 24:8 That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood upon the top of a rock, that it should not be covered. 
(The heat of my spirit. 3:14. This is when the blood is failed to cover up. )

"Three Unclean Spirits 
(Ottoman empire - Islamic Nazi.)

*Three foul spirits* of politics, economics and religion. (All inclusive of the Education)

Rev 16:12 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon *the great river Euphrates* ; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of the kings of the east might be prepared.
(The great river Euphrates are three rivers here! Nile, Tigris and Euphrates. What countries are you seeing? Genesis 15:18. 
""Dried up"" means no longer teaching the truth. Death worshippers. Acts 7:43. Took over by jackals. The beggarly elements of the world(cosmos). )
Rev 16:13 And I saw *three unclean spirits* like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
(Unclean is foul. 
Political, economic and religious. )
Rev 16:14 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to gather them to *the battle of that great day of God Almighty* .
(Who is devil?
Hebrews 2:14. The death. The rider of the green horse. The 4th seal. Also called dragon in Revelation 12:9. That multi-headed one world political beast in 13 worship. 🌐🐉🦂🌙 moon struck lunatic Baal worshippers bending over to lords of nations for bribes(donations) to wreck the land of living. Disgusting(abomination)! )

They forget about the 2nd Corinthians 10:4! 

Foul
: very unpleasant to taste or smell
: morally bad : very evil
: very bad or unpleasant

The swines don't want to be possessed. Luke 8:30. 

*Jackals* are wild dogs from Africa and Asia. Ezekiel 13:4. *Stupid* teachers. Wreck your vineyard in no time. Song 2:15. Wild dogs operate in group. No individuality allowed. 

Remember Lawrence of Arabia? 

The Three Rivers 

Gen 15:18 In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,  Unto thy seed have I given this land, *from the river of Egypt unto the great river, the river Euphrates* :
Gen 15:19 The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,
Gen 15:20 And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,
Gen 15:21 And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and the Jebusites.

Time to serve! Mark 10:42~45. 

Rev 16:17 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, *It is done* .
(Psa 22:30 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
Psa 22:31 They shall come,  and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born,  *that he hath done this* .
*Psalms 22* . Almost 1,000 years before the fact! Do you know David is a prophet? Acts 2:30. 
Even on the cross Jesus was teaching the whole Psalms 22 ! Matthew 27:46 and John 19:31. )
Rev 16:18 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.
Rev 16:19 And *the great city* was divided into three parts, and *the cities of the nations* fell: and great Babylon came in remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceness of his wrath.
Rev 16:20 And *every island* fled away, and *the mountains* were not found.
Rev 16:21 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was exceeding great.

Earthquake without the earth! 

Island is maritime nation. Mountains are nations. 

Having fun watching the election of 2016? 

Mohammedan

🌙 Moon's ""Kingdom""- dominion, realm.

Isa 60:12 For *the nation and kingdom* that will not serve thee shall perish;  yea, those *nations* shall be utterly wasted. 

Moon's realm. Whether you like it or not you gonna ""work"" on this! The sooner the better. 

Your covenant with *death* will not stand! 


Heb 4:1 Let us therefore fear,  lest, a promise being left us of entering into *his rest* , any of you should seem to come short of it. 
Heb 4:2 For unto us was the gospel preached,  as well as unto them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.
Heb 4:3 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said,  As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: although the works were finished from *the foundation of the world* .

"shubulabulu that's the one thing I really doubt. That's my main point I think. I don't know what's out there, but I believe in it, but I don't think it causes earthquakes on purpose. If it has any connection to mankind at all anymore, it's a personal one and not one that manipulates plate tectonics to say... What? The world is ending or something? What does that mean? The world has ended for a lot of species. Even presumably conscious ones like Neanderthals. Did they get earthquakes signalling ""the end of days""? Maybe, but I doubt it. The same goes for any other sentient species that has ever and will ever exist in the universe. Stuff happens in nature and is misinterpreted as God. God is an abstract force, and its only way of affecting us at all is through our psyche/spirit. As soon as anyone makes religion anything other than a personal connection, they've already muddied the waters to what a connection to God is. No earthquakes. Faith and belief are the only thing you have, and that's not something you can force on other people. I choose to believe that it's impossible to know what you're supposed to believe in. But it's okay, because it surrounds you so you just have to believe. And if you do anything to hurt anyone else because of it, you done fucked up",-0.8292,263
