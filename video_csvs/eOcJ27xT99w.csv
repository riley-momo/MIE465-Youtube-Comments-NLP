"I’m a ‘Hawks fan and the play they showed where J.D. McKissic threw it back to Russell Wilson who bombed it deep downfield for a Paul Richardson touchdown was a fantastic play, but I think the play on TNF against the Cardinals was by far our best one as Russell Wilson was able to evade three of four defenders before throwing a desperation heave to Doug Baldwin who caught it and ran down the sidelines.
