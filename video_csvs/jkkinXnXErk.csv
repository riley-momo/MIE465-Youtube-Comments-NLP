"I'll explain it to you since you obviously are somehow deficient: 
It IS relative to the video because the ""joke"" (Admittedly a disturbing joke, but a joke none the less. Much like your sense of logic) is understandable to the ""double-dip-phobic"".  A double-dip-phobic would not want to eat out of a pot that others at his table have repeatedly put their saliva covered chopsticks into. The temperature of the dish in question is COMPLETELY IRRELEVANT to them. Even though it may make no logical sense to others (like yourself, who probably has no problem eating other people's spit, and therefore has no idea how to relate), a chronic phobic does not answer to logic. Only their seemingly uncontrollable disgust. Just like the kind I've developed for your sorry ass. You wanna reply with another smart ass comment, babycakes? Cuz I can do this all day.",-0.9616,168
