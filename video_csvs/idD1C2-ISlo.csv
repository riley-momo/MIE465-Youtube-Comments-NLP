"Keith Urban - 
Parallel Line (Lyric Video)

[Verse 1]
You said ""I love you"" to me
당신이 나에게 “너를 사랑해.”고 말했지 
And I don't know what that means
그러나 나는 그 의미를 모르겠어.
So frozen my feet
그래서 나의 발이 차갑게 얼어 버렸지.
People use it too carelessly
사람이 사랑을 너무 자연스럽게 말하네.
And I couldn’t believe
그래서 나는 믿을 수가 없었지.
That you would dive in so deep
그것은 당신이 너무 적극적이었기 때문이야
And you said perfectly
그리고 당신은 더할 나위 없이 말했어.
Everything I’ve been feeling about you
내 모든 생각이 당신에 대해 관심을 갖게 되는 계기(契機)가 되었지
It’s time to break the chains that held me back from you
이것은 당신에게 내가 망설였던 사슬들을 끊는 순간이지. 

[Chorus]
So come on and
그래서 다가가고 
Take a little bit of my ★take:〖음악〗 연주하다, 켜다, 타다, 노래하다.
나의 박동이 조금씩 뛰네, = 나는 조금씩 박동을 타네.
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, I literally don't mind
아니야, 나는 글자 그대로 정신을 차릴 수가 없어(마음을 제어불가)
Just please don't misplace it
다만 제발 이것이 잘못되지 않기를 바라고
Take a little bit of my
나의 박동이 조금씩 뛰기 시작하네,= 감정이 요동치기 시작하면서
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음을
No, baby be mine now
아니지, 그대는 지금 나의 여자.
Baby, be mine now
그대는, 이제는 나의 사람.

Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
아마도 이것은 우리가 평행선에서 우리의 마음들이 합해지는 순간이야

[Verse 2]
Well I was never the type
그런데 나는 결코 이런 형(型)은 아니었어.
To put it all on the line
사랑은 그 선(線)에 모든 것을 놓네.
But I've been changing my mind since you opened my eyes
하지만 나는 당신이 나의 눈을 열어준 후 줄곧 나의 마음 변할 수 있었어
It was the way that the light
사랑은 이 빛에서 길이었지
Picked you out of that night
그 밤에 당신을 (나의 마음에) 태웠어.
Then you were right by my side
그 때 당신은 나의 옆에 바로 서 있었지
Put a soul in my body
나의 몸에 한 영혼이 놓이고
And now it’s time to close the space between the two of us
그리고 지금은 우리의 둘 사이의 공간[틈]을 닫을 순간이야.

[Chorus]
So come on and
그래서 다가가고
Take a little bit of my
나의 박동은 조금씩 커져가고
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, I literally don't mind
아니, 문자 그대로 마음을 잡을 수 없네.
Just please don't misplace it
다만 부디 사랑이 잘못되지 않기를
Take a little bit of my
나의 박동이 조금씩 뛰어가고
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, baby be mine now
아니야, 그대는 이제 나의 여자이고
Baby, be mine now
그대는, 이제 나의 사람이 이네.

Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
아마도 이게 우리가 평행선에서 우리의 마음이 하나가 되는 순간이죠.

[Bridge]
Oh, baby it's time
오, 그대여 사랑을 할 기회죠.
Oh, it's time
오, 사랑하기 좋은 기회야.

[Chorus]
Take a little bit of my
나의 박동이 조금씩 뛰고
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, I literally don't mind
아니, 문자 그대로 마음이 요동치네.
Just please don't misplace it
다만 제발 사랑이 잘못되지 않기를
Take a little bit of my
나의 박동이 조금씩 뛰고
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, baby be mine now
아니, 그대는 이제 나의 여자이네
Baby, be mine now
그대는. 이제 나의 사람이네
Take a little bit of my
나의 마음이 조금씩 그대 곁으로 
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, I literally don't mind
아니, 문자 그대로 요동을 치네.
Just please don't misplace it
다만 부디 이것이 잘못되지 않기를
Take a little bit of my
나의 마음은 조금씩 그대 곁에
Heart tonight
오늘밤에 마음이
No, baby be mine now
아니, 그대는 이제 나의 여자이네
Baby, be mine now
그대는, 이제 나의 사람이네
[Outro]
Maybe it’s time we put our hearts in a parallel line
아마도 이것은 평행선에서 우리의 마음들이 겹쳐지는 순간이야.
And put our hearts in a parallel line
그리고 우리의 마음들이 평행선에서 하나 되는
And put our hearts in a parallel line
그리고 우리의 마음들이 평행선에서 합해지는 것이네..",0.5574,765
