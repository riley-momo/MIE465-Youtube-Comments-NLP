Acting out sex scenes makes people much more vulnerable on-screen. Just because people are comfortable with their bodies doesn't mean they don't get uncomfortable.

Would be more true to the movies too - plus she's pretty as she is, over the top clothing just diminishes her in my opinion.
BTW: filming sex scenes is most likely a lot different from what people think it is.  A lot more stressful and generally very professional. I've been to porn sets and trust me, the ""oh, yeah, baby"" stuff is a lot more like pictured in season 2 of Game of Thrones (aka: this is horrible, play it with more feeling...): So, given the choice I'd much rather go for a coffee with the pretty lady than go film a sex scene with her.",0.9705,185
