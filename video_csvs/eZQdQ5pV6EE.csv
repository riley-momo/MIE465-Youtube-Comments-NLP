Hey.. took a note from casey.. dont use your slowmo shots too much... its getting irrelevant.. casey said himself..  always use shots like that for a bridge from act 1 to the next act.. make it relevant.  Dont over use it...    .  Casey style is lapse drone shots.. and you.. seems to be slowmo shots. Also make a line story so viewer can actually enjoy of how your day progress.. if its not wow enough.. dont bother to force it to be a ytube pideo *said casey,0.5667,100

"On the top of Haleakala on Maui I saw a guy bragging about how good his camera setup was as we all stood around waiting for a sunrise. When the sun started to come up it was blocked by a lower layer of clouds and then suddenly it appeared above that layer and made an incredibly beautiful cast of sunlight across the top of that cloud layer for the briefest of moments. We all said wow that was amazing as we took pictures with cell phones and point and shoot cameras. I looked at the guy and he was sitting facing away from the sunrise to block the light with his body so he could see the screen and play with it to ""get the perfect settings"". It was at that moment that I learned something I didn't consciously think about at the time, but I do think about it now after I watched one of Casey's videos talking about using the best camera available at the time to get the shot. The important part is to get the shot, next is to use the best camera available. Are you going to haul a DSLR around all the time? No. Maybe you know you're going to be doing some recording but a big camera is just too bulky, so take a good point and shoot to get better quality than a cell phone. Other times maybe you just have a cell phone on you when you see something worth a snap or a clip. If you watch Casey's videos you'll see one story might be made up of clips from different cameras at different levels of quality, but he puts them together into a story that is interesting to watch. In fact, the lower quality can add to the spontaneous done ""in the rough"" feel.",0.9819,326

Your video has been giving me lots of advices, ideas, tips and technics that i want to apply to eventual videos that i will make in the future. I dont have the drive or dream to become a YouTuber but it would be a nice hobby to make videos and post them online for my family friends and world to watch. But lets cut it to the point because i am talking a lot for one reason only, i love your videos, and this one which you posted a while back and i am not sure that you will see this message but this video brought a lot of memories from New Year parties, birthday and also random sight seeing traveling in Amsterdam and Maastricht, for that i wanted to say thank you, this video made me feel a lot of things and it felt good some what.
