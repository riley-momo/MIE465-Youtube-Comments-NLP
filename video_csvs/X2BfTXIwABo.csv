"Axel Alonoso, the previous Editor & Chief has been fired. Legacy was the last thing he did before losing his job to C.B. I hear it was Axel who started all these multiple relaunches every year. I agree with you. Some characters have been in limbo and constantly had their development cut short or ignored with all the do-overs & been thrown in different book after book. They need to get proper creative teams who care about developing characters, rather than regressing them for ""Nostalgia."" Then they need to let these books run at least a few years so characters can get proper development in them before they go somewhere else.

No.  You broke it, now fix it.  If your Fresh Start does not do more than move away from the nonsense of the past few years, then I'm not interested.  I do not want a golden-armed Thor with a new hammer.  FIX IT.  If you can't figure out how to make your broken past disappear, then you are only leaving the door open to more of the garbage that pushed me away in the first place.  Also:  ONE Spider-Man.  If you want to keep Miles Morales, fine... let him be the new Scarlet Spider or something else.  Otherwise kill him off, send him back to Earth-1610, or whatever to make him go away, because NOT INTERESTED.  Captain Marvel?  Sorry, after Mar-Vell himself, Monica Rambeau did it best... Carol Danvers should go back to being Ms. Marvel because it's what she's been good at.  Her entire time as Captain Marvel has made me hate her as a character and YOU as a publisher for ruining her as a character and the name Captain Marvel.

I forgot to mention I don’t like the new twist of how T’Challa & Ororo met, with portraying her as a damsel in distress instead of originally saving T’Challa in the jungle using her  powers. Also, it’d be great if the debate on whether or not Storm is a Goddess or a Mutant. I know Charles Xavier classifies her as a mutant, from his perspective, but the origins of Storm & how she was actually worshipped back in Africa comes from real African-Mythos of Gods & Goddess who personified the elements, The Orishas.

I haven't read them cuz I don't know if they are officially canon. I heard some readers don't like how Coates is taking BP, of course I'll read for myself.

SN: I just recently read an article (io9 Gizmodo) published last month Jan 2018, of Chris Claremont thinking that their marriage was a bad idea, even though he himself said there was nothing wrong with their marriage. It was beautiful and filled with adventures. You know what his ""excuse"" was? He thought both characters were ""too big"" for each other, if they had kids, that would age them, and comic book characters can't age. So he basically broke them up for NOTHING!!!! Which is what most of the readers speculated during that HORRIBLE Avg vs X-Men run. I find it funny that Reed & Sue are allowed by the writers to work on their marriage, have powerful children, AND AGE, but Storm and Black Panther can't?! FOH! The writers at least the old ones, seem really dead set on keeping  Storm & Black Panther separate and away from each other, knowing good and damn well, Storm is actually a better asset to the Black Panther storylines, instead of being an under appreciated character in the X-Men.",0.8901,270

"Your giving to much hype and relaunching Marvel almost every year....wtf. be humble. You maybe should do a Reboot because all the story lines are a big mess. Dc keeps it simple. Learn! When Dc sucked 20-30 years ago, Marvel was great, now it's the opposite.",0.784,56

looks like i could give marvel another chance especially since Tony is back however i noticed one thing Sana Amanat and Gwendolyn Willow Wilson  are NOT OUT!!!! and thanks to a youtuber who spent some money on a couple issues of Ms Marvel Kamala Khan i know what it looks like on the inside and while i am all for alternate realities they need to serve as purpose beyond propaganda and their alternate reality doesn't so it looks like marvel may be getting back on the right track IN MY OPINION.,0.9582,95
