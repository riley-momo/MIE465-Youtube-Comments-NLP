+Giovanda Richardson ....You dont know what type of relationship they had You talking to a Luther and PATTI fan....You probably dont know either history...If Luther was gay which he was and deceased NOW what is there to be in denial about and to who...? That clearly was (AT THAT TIME) ...for his mother and the women fans...Patti did what she knew was best obviously he chose HER to tell and talk about it with..If he was the president of her fan club I'm sure they covered a lot a things from then until his death..and Like I said were a few weeks away from 2018 people are not worried about that in the closet foolishness cause today is not like it was back then...barriers and history have been broken since then...and you sit there and defend Wendy Williams of All People that rusty hatchet face no good cow has NO respect for anybody considering her career is to destroy other peoples...as much as she talked about poor Whitney Houston before and after her death...Girl Bye.,0.2835,201

"Ah... so this is what everyone is talking about with patti ""Outing"" luther. I think people already had an idea and kind of knew, I don't think she necessarily outed him but speaking on his situation was sad to hear. I'm glad he chose not to come out because back then people were so harsh and by him being a man of color the black community would have ripped him to shreds acting like some interrogating detectives that he owed answers to. But in reality his personal life was his business and nobody else's especially if he's not in bed with you. But RIP to him, we as his fans love and support him",0.8094,123

Andy Cohen what was your point of asking about Luther Vandross that man is gone. If he want that out he would have let everyone know that...Even though real fans knew all along  but we didn't care because he was family. Whats wrong with you Andy I bet their are things about you that's secrets that you don't want out...if you die tomorrow you would not want that out...I hope that every little nasty deed you have ever done be put out about you. What does Luther have to do with your shady little show...the man is dead. I'm going to let Auntie Patti slide....she may have be off her game that night she is getting up their...she get a pass...Leave the dead alone. That man did not want his business out.,-0.9825,152

"Luther Vandross was living a lie, especially to himself. 
The public claimed him as heterosexual and he was not. The very fact that he was gay and a brilliant singer was all the more of a reason for people to know the truth. Luther Vandross suffered in is last days on earth, due to the very fact of not coming out of the closet. Any gay man will tell you this is torture. Which could also explain why his life ended so soon, along with the other medical issues he had before his death. I’m really tired of the heterosexual population attempting to claim so much “GAY” talent the gay singers & artist tend to bring to the table. Sam Smith is on the right track let them see the truth who you really are & what you are bringing to the table.",-0.576,158

Luther wouldn't have had the success he had if everyone knew he was singing to a man. He did right not coming out with it because it would've been career suicide.

Patti kept it a secret from his mother and women fans just as she was asked to do by Luther.
