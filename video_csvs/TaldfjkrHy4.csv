"Hey TurboTax, I went and watched all the other ads you have on your channel that are trying to be ""cute"" or funny and honestly, they can't even touch this one.  If I were you, I'd delete them all and make as many different commercials of this bear busting the moves that you can.  And the person who came up with this ad, isn't getting paid nearly enough because because of this little bear, TurboTax is going to be the company on everyone's lips this year come tax time and you're gonna make a killing.  Btw, get to work on making these little guys for people to buy.  And please, please, stop making weird gruesome vids of people getting impaled by fish, crushed by cars, killed by machines and chemicals, and falling off of cruise ships.  The punchline isn't nearly worth the cost.  But tiny dancing knit bears?  I think you struck gold with that one. 😉",-0.8543,178
