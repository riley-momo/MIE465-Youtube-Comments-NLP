"Oh what could go so wrong, with a girl and a zombie?",-0.6113,14
"Ohhh la la la la la
Ohhh yeah
I know we might be crazy (Ohh) 
But did you hear the story (yeah)
I think I heard it vaguely 
A girl and a zombie

Oh tell me more boy, sounds like a fantasy
Oh what could go so wrong with a girl and a zombie?
You're from the perfect paradise
And I'm living on the darkest side
Ooh I've got a feeling, if you get to know me
Right from the sight she caught my eye
And something inside me came to life
Ooh I've got a feeling, if you get to know me

Someday, this could be this could be ordinary
Someday, could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side (yeah yeah)
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say ""we gonna be someday""

We gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We gonna be someday
We gonna be someday

Girl you look delicious!
Oh I mean gorgeous
Now your getting fearless
Oh I'm just rooting for us
It'd be different with superpowers, we'd be so flawless
Yeah we can make these two worlds ours, I'm rooting for us
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark, imagine how they would start a spark
You got my attention, what happens next then?
Movies and long walks in the park
Hanging out anywhere we walk
I like where the way you're thinking, I can almost see it

Someday, this could be this could be ordinary
Someday, could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side (yeah yeah)
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say ""we gonna be someday""
Someday, someday

So let them talk if they wanna
Let them talk if they're gonna
We're gonna do what we wanna
Let them talk, let them talk, if they wanna, they wanna

Someday, this could be this could be ordinary
Someday, could we be something extraordinary?
You and me side by side 
Out in the broad daylight
If they laugh, we'll say ""we gonna be someday""
Someday, someday
We gonna be someday
Someday, someday
We gonna be someday",0.9889,396
