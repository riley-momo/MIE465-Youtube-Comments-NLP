"Let's just state facts Tyrese talks to fucking much‼️ It all started with the Dr. Dre's Apple/Beats deal that Tyrese almost blew for posting a ""drunken"" video online boasting about & the deal that wasn't even confirmed... ***see The Defiant Ones Jimmy Iovine interview*** Then The DeWayne Johnson rants stared followed by the Norma & his daughter stuff, Will & Jada finally saying his current wife was pregnant and she wasn't⁉️ Tyrese just needs to keep quiet & logoff for a few years at this point‼️ He has a bad case of ATTENTION WHORE-ISM & it definitely not a good look personally or professionally‼️ #Deplorable",-0.7511,126
