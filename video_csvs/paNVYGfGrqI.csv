amtrack should just shutdown for 6 months and check out all these systems on the lines how can they still be in operation and not care about any of these tragic stories I've never rode amtrack but now I never will nor will anyone in my family this is unacceptable and I hope it comes back on whoever keeps the wheels turning and not solving the problem like we say here in Texas COWBOY UP!!!,0.3601,78

due to the fact that the us did not put any money into the trains and transportation for over 70 years even if they started to fix it all at once 30 years ago it wouldnt make a difference for another 40 plus years dont forget people back in the 30s 40s and 50s wanted to joy of cars so noone cared for trains or buses unlike other countries like japan Germany france the uk even brazil is better than  the US now and china,0.9177,85
