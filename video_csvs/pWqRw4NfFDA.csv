The plot is family dynamics just like the plot of Six Feet Under and a whole bunch of other all white shows about families that I do not imagine you complain about. Get over yourselves, so you are no longer the center of the universe, it was bound to happen. It is a show about a somewhat dysfunctional family where the members of the family come from different ethnic backgrounds and therefore see the world differently the other members.

"Milly Borkovic. Damn thats really sad that you've been guilted into thinking anything pro white is racist. No I live in Nevada outside of Vegas and its very liberal here from all the Californians we get. I don't go around talking about racial issues to people I meet and I respect everyone I meet , so there's no reason for so many brown people to have preconcieved biases against me just because I'm white. I take it you don't know very many ""people of color"".  If it were reversed and blacks or browns were endangered of going extinct I bet you'd support them wouldn't you? Its really sad that so many white people believe its racist to be proud of their own heritage and culture, yet they support any other race that feels the same way. You're glad ""my people"" will die out? Well with a name like Milly Borkovic I'm 99.9% sure you're one of ""my people"". You say you're pro diversity but you're not, you're only pro racial diversity. But why? Nothing benefits our countries from racial diversity when people naturally self segregate into their own groups an communities based on their race. And doing so only creates division among these different groups. So that saying ""diversity is our strength"" is comletely false. Racial diversity has nothing but a negative impact on our countries. (No not because the color of their skin) So why do you support racial diversity other than your fear of being called a racist? When whites become the minority what do you think happens to western society when most immigrants and poc don't assimilate to our culture?",0.7345,303
Milly Borkovic. Im a moron because I realize racial diversity will lead to the eventual extinction of our race? Based on your name I assume you're white. White people will become the minority in their own countries within the next 50 years at the rate foreigners are immigrating to Europe and North America. Do you care if your people and your culture dies out? Racial diversity has absolutely no benefit for our countries or our people. Wake up,0.2836,84
Milly Borkovic. Its not paranoia and its not a conspiracy theory. Statistics show that whites will be a minority in the US and Europe before 2050. Its a fact. Google it if you don't believe me. Im not racist or anything but I don't want to see our people be mixed out of existance. Which is what will eventually happen. Its a very real threat that both you and I will have to deal with within our lifetime weather you like it or not.,0.0689,92
"Milly Borkovic. Lol a little over dramatic there don't ya think? You'd kill someone that you don't know over a disagreement on YouTube? You're 16 yo girl mentality is showing again. I have a life thanks for your concern. I'm only 22 making $24 an hour as a supervisor at a factory in charge of guys twice my age and I didn't need to waste my money on a degree to do it. Why are you so full of self hatred and guilt? All I've said is I care about the preservation of European people, their countries, culture and history. What is so wrong about that? What makes any of that racist? Black people and brown people feel the exact same way about their countries, so why is it so wrong for me to think the same? Explain to me how any of that is racist whatsoever. Simple questions. If you reply, don't respond with ""you're not worth explaining to"" or ""you're racist"" give me an actual response or don't reply at all",-0.9728,195
"Milly Borkovic. Oh you live in Austalia? Well no wonder you have this mentality lol. Australia is completely brainwashed with liberal propaganda. Way more than the US. Look at your African gang problem in Melbourne, diversity is working great there huh? And thats what you want for your whole country? No I feel sorry for you lol. Don't worry you'll agree with me when the problem spreads to where you live. Present day South Africa is Australia's future. Australia is 92% white.... your country is one of the least ethnically diverse countries among white countries. Part of the reason you don't understand the problem with diversity. You've never experienced racism and have absolutely no clue what racism is. You call me racist because you have no argument. When you said you were ""educated"" did you mean right out of high school educated? I thought I was talking to someone worth having a conversation with. Guess not",-0.5826,177
"Milly Borkovic. Well thats pretty sad that you don't care if your people and heritage dies out, any other race would. Wanting to preserve our people, our countries, and our history does not make me racist. Western civilization will collapse when white people become the minority. It mattters to millions of people. Your analogy is irrelavant. Race mixing is not evolution. Just because you don't care about the future of your people doesn't make you educated or morally superior it makes you naive. I dont fear their skin color, I fear their lifestyle and mentality.  Most ""people of color"" have negative biases toward white people. I live in the southwest and most brown people I've met hate white people. Having this sort of mentality makes it a problem when they become the majority. Which is why I called it a threat. No I don't fear we will be enslaved. Race is a lot more than just skin color. I thought you were educated? If you don't care about your race going extinct, atleast care about the potential collapse of western society.",-0.9618,205
"Milly Borkovic. Well you avoided my questions and completely changed the subject. Again with your childish over dramatization over this whole thing. This wasn't even part of the argument but since you're so concerned, I work in a huge factory making lithium batteries with about 5,000 employees and I'am one of like 50 supervisors that doesn't have a college degree. I'm pretty sure that says something. Me not having a college degree does not make me uneducated or unqualified for my position and it doesn't mean I'm less intelligent than someone who does have a college education. You for example have a college education, yet you sound like an immature naive 16 yo girl. Lmao $24 is not minimum wage anywhere in the US. In my state minimum wage is like $9 or $10. So for only being 22 making $24 an hour, I'd say I'm doing pretty good. Compared to most people my age struggling to make $12 an hour. My job won't become obsolete any time soon. Idc about Australia's free health care or cheaper education. Its not worth going to college in the US because of how expensive it is, and I wasn't comparing the two. I could really care less that you make more than me lol. I make $50k USD and you make $80k USD. ""I make double what you make"" you have the mind of a child lol. Anyways back to the original argument here.... poc definitely feel that way about their countries. Ask any poc if they care about the future well being of their race and their people's countries. Every single one of them will say yes. This is how I know you don't know very many poc or met very many poc. Every poc you do know was likely born in Australia and has been assimilated to your culture for atleast a few generations. Its very different here in the US. Blacks here support anything pro black and pro african. Hispanics here are the same way supporting anything mexican or latin american. They care about their own people and their own countries before they care about people and countries outside their ethnic group. Which is natural. And ethno nationalosm its perfectly accptable among these two ethnicities in US society. But when its white people that have the same view its racist and demonized in our society. Me saying you should fear violent immigrants that happen to have a difderent skin color isn't racist. The majority of these people leaving africa lived in countries where its normal to have violence, where its normal to rape women, where its normal to murder people. And when they don't assimilate they bring that ideology with them. How do you not see that as being problematic? If there were a group of european immigrants under the same circumstances, I'd say fear them too. But thats not whats happening. Do I believe in reverse racism? Well considering that most black people's biases against white people are because of slavery in the past. Yes that would be the literal definition of reverse racism. So should I just ignore the literal meaning of reverse racism just to pander to self hating whites like you? Wow you're completely fucked in the head lol. You probably also believe poc can't be racist don't you? Don't bother replying lol you have the mentality and IQ of a teenage girl.",0.9161,626
"Milly Borkovic. With an education like that you should try to sound a little less like a 16 yo girl. Like I said, you'll agree with me when you experience first hand the problem with racial diversity. With a 92% white population and some of the strictest immigration policies in the world, thats also an island, Australia is basically sheltered from the rest of the world. So you might not ever even have that experience in your lifetime. I wouldn't expect you to understand the issue with diversity. If I grew up under the same circumstances I'd have the exact same view as you. If I knew you were Austalian from the start I wouldn't have bothered bringing all this up.",0.8876,133

"This show is so bad on so many levels, its really boring. I first tuned in the middle of an episode where the high school daughter was having a class debate; the girl looks like she 30 years old and of all the other ""teens"" looked like they been left back for a decade too and they debated using talking points from MSNBC to represent liberals and FOX for conservatives. People don't talk or act like that. I thought maybe i was missing something so I later found the episode on-demand and watched ep1 from the beginning and it was the same overly written dialogue, un-charismatic bad actors, and slow story telling. I had to turn off. who watched this crap at HBO and thought they should order an entire season, they need to be fired for approving this",-0.931,151

"Worm Werm HAHAHA OMG DID YOU ACTUALLY SAY YOU’RE NOT RACIST?!?! 😂😂 you literally couldn’t be more daft. And my calling you paranoid was because who fucking cares if white people become a minority??? “A real threat we’ll have to face”?? 😂 LMFAO they’re not gonna make us slaves! For fucks sake, we were taught in school when we were like 10 years old about dominant and recessive genes and why we have blue eyes or brown hair or light skin. We were also taught at the same time that the dominant genes were brown hair, brown eyes, dark skin. And that eventually most people will have dark skin. It’s basic evolution, same way we don’t need out wisdom teeth or appendix anymore. This doesn’t phase me one bit at all. Why? Because I’m not racist and I’m educated. For you to see this as a problem all but proves your racism, ie. Fear of people of colour. ITS JUST SKIN. Get the fuck over yourself.",-0.9478,214
"Worm Werm I am happy to see that not everyone has fallen into the SJW trap. I can't understand how stupid people like ""Milly Borkovic"" are. Literally avoiding your questions and ignoring facts and statistics. Her only arguments were that you were racist (based on nothing), that she earned more, and that you should kys because you disagreed.

I have lived in Sweden my whole life, and I have seen first hand how a ""progressive"" government ruins the country. When I was younger Sweden was probably one of the safest countrys on earth. But after all the mass immigration it doesn't go a day without someone getting killed or raped. I consider myself a very liberal person, but anyone can see that these are very real and dangerous problems in the western world.",-0.8822,151
"Worm Werm I’m talking to you “like a 16 year old girl” because that’s the respect you deserve. I’m not putting any effort at all into bringing facts or statistics into it because you are one fucking person. And I could care less if you lived or died. You don’t matter to me, so no, I’m not putting any effort in. 

You on the other hand need a fucking life. And a god damn job. Seriously get a job. And some sense.

Stop coming at me with the excuses for why you’re racist. I don’t care what your pathetic excuses are. You’re still scum. But I truly can’t get over the fact that some people who are blatantly racist don’t realize it. I truly believe you’re not lying, and that you genuinely believe that you’re not racist, and that just baffles me. 

I’d honestly push you off a cliff and feel nothing at this point. You’re not human. So why would I feel anything? It’s not like anyone would miss you.",-0.6943,224
"Worm Werm dude, you’re literally too dumb to argue with. You. Are. Racist.

Plus I don’t know where you got the notion that I don’t know very many POC? 😂 I’m Australian. I’m fairly sure we’re the most ethnically diverse country in the world 😂 I know people from everywhere with every kind of belief. 

I feel sorry for you.",-0.8271,81
"Worm Werm dude, you’re the worst kind of racist. The kind that truly don’t believe they are. Everything you write makes my skin crawl. You’re a despicable person. Where’s the south west? What Utah or Arizona or some shit? The red states? Well that makes sense then. You only think you’re not racist because you compare yourself to the intense alt-right. And of course you’ve met some black people who don’t like you. You ooze racist. I don’t like you either. My heart goes out to black people living in the red states. Y’all are fucked. I’m glad your people will die out. It will only make for a better future.",-0.9463,148

"Worm Werm not at all over dramatic. This isn’t a “disagreement”. You’re a vile disgusting excuse for a human being. I wouldn’t kill you, because you can’t kill something that isn’t alive. You’re dead inside and your point of view is like a cancer that is spreading. 

You only make $24 an hour?? As a supervisor? Lol so you’re at the top and that’s how much you’ll make forever? LMFAO. You’re proud of that? (Ps. I love that you tried to dismiss how uneducated you are by saying “you didn’t need a degree” to make minimum wage 😂) what happens to you when your job becomes obsolete? As most factory jobs are. Haha you’re fuckeeeeed mate. And I think you’re forgetting, that in Australia, not only do we have free health care, but education is also a tiny fraction of what the equivalent that one of America’s colleges would compare to my top university. I’m 28, I make close to $110k a year, and that number is only rising. Even with currency conversion that’s still like double what you make 😂

And for the love of god, P.O.C. Do. Not. Feel. That. Way. About. Other. Countries.

When you mentioned the African “gang problem” we had here in Melbourne and implied that I should be scared when it reaches me, that’s racist. Your blatant irrational fear of black peoples comes from your, down to the rotten core, racism. 

If I ask you, “do you believe in reverse racism?” and you answer anything other than a solid no. You’re racist. 

Do everyone a favor, including yourself, and just stop breathing 👋🏼",-0.9732,366
"Worm Werm you’re an absolute clown!! 😂 African Gang Problem hahahahahaha omfg you need to understand that we have such little news here that you cannot begin to compare the difference of if that was reported in your news.

I have a bachelor of commerce and an advanced degree in business from university. What do you have? A certificate of attendance from the KKK?

Please get away from me with your tin foiled nonsense.
