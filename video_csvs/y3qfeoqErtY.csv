"Incorrectly you keep calling Louisville a ""small city,"" when it is the 15 largest US city and during the 1830s, we were the 10th largest US city.

Louisville has the 4th largest convention space in North America.  We host most of the national conventions that need millions of square footage for major conventions.

Aviation started in Louisville in 1837 with the first aviation business being a tethered hot air balloon.

The oldest continuously operated airport IN THE WORLD is Bowman Field (KLOU) here in Louisville.  We have the world's oldest aero club too.

The first AIR MAIL was actually launched from Churchill Downs, where the Kentucky Derby, the oldest annual sporting event takes place in North America.  That was started by my distant cousin in 1875.

UPS has nearly 400 airplanes arriving at the WORLD HUB, so the Memphis operations are less than half of what we have in Louisville.

You also seem unfamiliar that Louisville has one of the two largest airshows in North America each year which his called THUNDER OVER LOUISVILLE, but the last hour of that airshow is the world's largest fireworks show.  We have about 750,000-1 million plus people line both sides of the Ohio River to watch our 7-8 hour airshow followed by the fireworks.  The TV broadcast of this annual airshow goes to 100+ nations around the world.  This is why I cannot imagine your failure at knowing any of our aviation history.

When the USAF celebrated their 50th anniversary and their 75 anniversary, they did it in two airshows, Oshkosh and THUNDER OVER LOUISVILLE as these are the nations two largest annual airshows.

Louisville has about 181 years of aviation history.  You sincerely need to do more research on aviation in Kentucky before claiming that we have a ""small city"" as it tells me you never did research on Louisville, KY.

Even Kentucky's military aviation started at Bowman Field (KLOU).

Bowman Field was the BUSIEST AIRPORT IN THE WORLD from WWII until the early 1970s.  The pilots who flew into France the night before the raid on Normandy Beach were trained to fly the ""flying coffins"" here in Louisville.  There was also an Air Ambulance (female) Nursing School here at Bowman Field (KLOU).  Pilots, nurses, and other crew learned their skills for air evacuations.

Bowman Field is one of fewer than 10-worldwide airports to still have an operational 1930s tetrahedron.  Ours still works and it is greatly appreciated.

The first UFO to shoot down a pilot, Captain Thomas Mantell, a pilot from the KENTUCKY AIR NATIONAL GUARD is a history that is well-documented on Youtube and other sites.  That was back in the 1940s.  Mantell was part of a flight already in the sky near Fort Knox, KY (Godman Field), and numerous UFO reports from Cinci, OH, to Tenn, and around KY were called in to various Air Traffic Control Towers.  Mantell and his flight were engaged.  He was the only one to give full pursuit as the others ran out of fuel and returned to base.

Next, even RETRACTABLE LANDING GEAR were first invented in Kentucky in the early 1900s by inventor Matthew B. Sellars.

The first aviation death was in Kentucky by the family friend/crew member who helped Matthew B. Sellars who was propping the plane in preparation for a flight, but the engine started early and that poor man could not get out of the way of the propeller.  There was no pilot in the cockpit at the time.

The rest of your film had interesting points, clear video, and I hope it was better researched than what you incorrectly accounted for Louisville's connections to aviation.

I would appreciate you updating this video as you sincerely have not done your due diligence on Louisville, KY or on the much wider number of flights for UPS or the other commercial aviation from here.

"You are using ""reductionistic thinking"" which is limited and flawed.  If you do not know the entire history, YOU DO NOT KNOW OR UNDERSTAND THE PRESENT.  If you want to comprehend why UPS has the WORLD HUB, it means you must know why thousands of other cities around the world failed to meet the needs/expectations for UPS and why Louisville is that singular place on Earth they decided to use.

The westward expansion of the USA in the 1700s and 1800s was the Ohio River.  The only obstruction to navigation on the 981 miles of the Ohio River is the FALLS OF THE OHIO RIVER a 26.5 foot drop over a 2.5 mile distance.  This caused there to be three cities on the Kentucky side of the Falls, (Louisville, Portland, and Shippingport).  

This impacted why over 110+ years ago why FORD MOTOR COMPANY created their first plant in Kentucky.  The McAlpine Lock and Dam has more commercial barge navigation that the Panama Canal (in tonnage) each day.  Ford used to ship their cars on barges before we had the major car carriers you see on the highways of today.

Today, the world's largest truck manufacturing building (Ford Manufacturing) is here in eastern Louisville, but Ford has another major car manufacturing plant here too.  It is adjacent to the UPS WORLD HUB.

Dennis, what happened in the 1830s was that Kentucky began to have RAILROADS for shipping purposes.  Those railroads began when there was less than 100 miles of track in North America.  Kentucky is far more progressive than most folks realize.  The combination of commercial maritime traffic, our having the world's continuously operated airport (Bowman Field-KLOU), and our railroads meant that products could be made here efficiently, but sold all over the world.

Today, it is the same thing!

The decisions of our ancestors hundreds and thousands of years ago still impact us today, but you must learn about history, culture, and heritage if you ever want to understand the ""present"" time that seems to have you fixated.

Whenever I perform Underwater Archaeological research on rivers looking for wrecked vessels, it is not just the steamboat that I must understand that could be located in the river, but I must comprehend the entire national history, Admiralty and Maritime Industry, climatology, hydrology, geomorphology, and so much more.  There is a far bigger picture and it includes comprehending the entire history of Earth, both written and unwritten.

"You forgot the dirty little secret about air freight: vast amounts of it never flies anywhere. It rides in long-haul trucks. A long haul tractor-trailer can carry up to about 48,000 pounds of cargo. At 68mph it can move that cargo 680 miles in 10 hours. That also happens to be around the diatance between most US major cargo hubs. Or, more to the point, secondary hubs between the super hubs.
