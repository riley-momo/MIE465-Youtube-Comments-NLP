For example, the SLS image you show is most similar to the Block 2 configuration (although we'll probably go without the paint job). This version will have room for no astronauts (because it's in cargo configuration), but it will be able to deliver 130,700 kg to LEO (which is about 144 tons, or approximately 48 African forest elephants) when we build it.",0.2598,131
