I have used them from my first iPhone 4 and they do work and protect.  No damage what so ever to any of my phones even after rough treatment.  A very happy camper!

People keep saying the IPhone X is the worst iPhone but Ik that they just don’t know what’s good,0.3182,23
Phone absolutely sucks.  Sent it back.  Phone is slow and to do one thing takes one or two more steps then any other iPhone.  Face ID dumb you have to do two steps first one to open the phone then swipe up.  Basically every thing you know an iPhone can do add one or two more steps.  Those steps are not quick they suck and take too long.  Nothing is better than Touch ID. Face ID is the worst concept and basically another way technology wants the screen in your face all day and will cause and kill many people with car accidents. Camera sucks for what it is. Still blurs and keep a bright light around.,-0.9149,127
