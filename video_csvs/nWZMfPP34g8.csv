I've always been intrigued with giant centipedes, Sydney Funnel Web spiders, Brazilian Wandering spiders and Scorpions. I use to have a cage with Scorpions and of course mom hated it. Too bad I didn't pursue toxicology in college like I initially had planned. And remember there is no such thing as a 'poisonous' snake, spider, scorpion or centipede.
