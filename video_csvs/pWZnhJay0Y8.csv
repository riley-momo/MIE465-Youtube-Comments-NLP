Yes. The 2009 one will ALWAYS BE THE DEFINITIVE MULAN for

TOTALLY AGREED!!! Liu's acting is BAD + BORING! I suspect
she was chosen because she is popular in China. I wanted Tang
Wei, who is a far better actress, is good with languages (speaks
Cantonese fluently), can sing (the film Office) + most definitely
fits the role of an iconoclast.(Lust, Caution). From interviews
here on Youtube, I find Liu's English to be lacking; she does not
have an American Cadence, although she lived in the States for
~ 5 yrs.",0.7994,104

Actually Crystal Liu was the leading actress for the movie of the Eternal Love (Aka Ten Miles of peach blossom). Where she had to show a stronger image of a woman especially since it was also gender bender. Basically having to disguise as a male. She also was required to do many fighting scenes and the Chinese entertainment industry is known for their martial arts in the air. The actors are usually pulled up by those strings which is pretty hard to move in.

And a side note, the story of Mulan originated from a poem, which highlights the virtue of filial piety. The empire is drafting man for war, and Mulan's father was enlisted, so she went in his stead. However, nothing in the poem told of Mulan saving the country, or finding true love, or even coming back alive. So, the entire thing is open to interpretation, or, in Disney's case, their imagination.",0.9602,142

"VIEWER QUESTION: 🤔️Hi Grace!  🙋‍♂️Gal Gadot has already shown that an Asian actress can be the biggest star in Hollywood in these days. I wonder if Liu Yifei as Mulan could achieve the same level? I know some Chinese actresses such as Zhang Ziyi did great jobs in movies like Memoirs of a Geisha but even she couldn't handle a Hollywood blockbuster. And most movies add Chinese actors just for business reason and their roles are not important.Or Hollywood just doesn't many Asain leading roles so there won't be a chance for her to become another Hollywood star like Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? Maybe only one Hollywood blockbuster and then she has to come back to China. So what do you think? Does Hollywood have another chance for Asian actresses or it's just Gal Gadot? Also, a story happens in ancient China with a lot of Chinese roles speaking English seems weird to me. Btw, your pronunciation of 'Liu Yifei' was kind of cute.

"We call her ‘fairy sister’ because that was the one of the first roles she played in Chinese TV. A series called “Demigods and Semidevils”, it was based on a martial arts novel by Jin Yong. One of the main characters in the show call her by that. But in another TV show, “Return of the Condor Heroes”, she plays a pretty badass martial arts instructor.",0.8074,79

"Well to say China is a stickler is kinda harsh but I can see it. Personally, if another country was going to portray one of my national hero/heroine I would appreciate it if they used an appropriate person. Imagine if Ben Franklin was a middle eastern dude or if Martin Luther king Jr was white. That would piss anyone off.",-0.0653,67
Well you need to see her action scenes with swords and SHE'S GOOOOOOOD,0.2732,13
"Well, Chinese wont see Liu as a pop singer for sure. Yeah and Crystal Liu is not a good option obviously. Hope she could do an excellent job otherwise someone else might do anyway afterwards.",0.8688,39
"Well，it‘s amazing even for Chinese honestly，but……hummmm，not bad。Liu is the most adorable star in China，but different with the kind of adorable other country’s people thought。the “Fairy sister” of China are not girls only sing or dance or play with animals everyday。they fight and beautiful，they fight like dancing，but very very powerful。Imaging Wonder Woman dancing and defeat enemy。（Yeah……it‘s weird）And actually， a “Fairy sister” must both beautiful and strong，means Li must be very strong。Yeah，she’s KungFu is great，very great I mean，her most character must fight。

And，I must say，she is so adorable！！！！！！！Oh！my！god！how can she exist！！！She is soooooooooooo pretty！It‘s Impossible to find other girl can be more “Chinese pretty” than Liu！Yeah，there are so many pretty in the world，but she is the most “Chinese pretty”！！！And……yep，we also think she is too pretty to be MuLan。Butttttt，she must be the most beautiful MuLan！！！Hummmmmmmmmm，well，now there are many “beautiful” male stars in China（I hate them honestly），so……a beautiful MuLan may not so bad。Don‘t forget，It's Disney moive，MuLan is a warrior，but also a princess~

Good Job Disney，Chinese will be crazy for this moive，Liu is sooooooooooo pretty！！！！！！！！Oh！my！godddddddd！I am so excited！！！！！！！By the way，I'm a girl and I’m straight，but I love her！She likes the beauty from the poetry written thousands years ago！！！Disney want a Chinese princess，so choose her！I‘m so excited！！！！！！！！",0.9907,369

"Yifei Liu is actually well-known for her acting career in historical period drama/costume drama, and many of those shows are acrobatic fighting ones (which in this case, quite fit to casting Mulan).

"You did “Research” on this actress... and besides talking about her past Films like The Forbidden Kingdom, her martial arts skills, or anything about her line of acting... you talked about her nickname and her soft appearance being a problem.

When you look at the cast list for Aladdin they have clearly employed Middle Eastern (Iranian and Iranian-American) actors for other roles, Naomi Scott also has the look to pull of an Arabian Princess.  Most times I would agree but I don't really see why her selection is an issue just because she's from England.",0.5621,86
You should check the forbidden kingdom out,-0.4215,7
"You should consider doing more research. Liu YiFei in fact has played a role in which she has to pretend to be a guy before, although it was a rather short scene I'll say, that she pulled it off pretty well.  Also she is bilingual meaning she is fluent both in chinese AND english. No hate, but really, don't judge a person you dont even know well enough to talk about.",0.1901,79

Zhang ziyi  is an amazing actress so always thought she would be a great Mulan.
