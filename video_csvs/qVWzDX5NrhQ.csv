"(Christ Teaches on Repentance):

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:3).

I tell you, Nay:
but, except ye repent,
ye shall all likewise perish.
(Luke 13:5).

***(Unless you repent): Jesus point here is that everyone stands at the edge of death until repentance occurs. The death in view here is spiritual, not physical).
***(The manner in which a person dies is not a measure of righteousness; what is important is not to die outside of God's grace and care. The way to avoid such a fate is to repent, to come to God through the care of the physician Jesus. (John 5:32)<--I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance).
***(Repent/Repentance): The Hebrew word translated repent means, “Turn Back” or “Turn around”. The word refers to a reversal or change of direction. The Prophets commonly used this word to call Israelites to a radically conscious rejection of their past Sin. When used as a theological term, repentance implies not only sorrow but a complete turnaround: To change one’s mind about Sin, receive God’s provision of Salvation, and return whole heartedly to him).

He spake also this parable;
A certain man had a fig tree 
planted in his vineyard; 
and he came and sought fruit thereon, 
and found none.

***(A fig tree): Often represents God's blessing, or a people who have a special relationship with God. The man in this parable represents God; the fig tree represents Israel).
Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard,

Behold,

these three years I come seeking fruit 
on this fig tree, 
and find none: 
cut it down; 
why does it use up the ground?

And he answering said unto him,

Lord, 
let it alone this year also, 
till I shall dig around it, 
and fertilize it:

And if it bear fruit, 
well:
but if not,

then after that 
thou shalt cut it down.

***(But if not): If the tree, symbolizing Israel, would yield some fruit it could escape judgment; a failure to be fruitful would result in judgment).

(Luke 13:6-9).

***(John 15:5-10)<---(Jesus)<---I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing. If a man abide not in me, he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered; and men gather them, and cast them into the fire, and they are burned. If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you. Herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit; so shall ye be my disciples. As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: (continue ye in my love). If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.

***(Matthew 3:10<---(Jesus)<---And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees: therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 7:19)<---(Jesus)<---Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.

***(Matthew 3:8)<---(Jesus)<---Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

***(Before I really turned to the Lord, I used to have dreams, I was about to swim in Lava like a volcano. But praise the Lord, he did not make me feel it. Thank you Jesus  :)....",0.9909,780

"Did you know that if we make Jesus Christ our personal Lord and Savior, everytime we sin we have every right to as Jesus Christ to forgive us of our sin(s)?  We can be cleansed as though we have never sinned and graciously spared damnation. Jesus Christ did what no other human being has ever done or could ever do. He is the ONLY on this planet who has never sinned. Because He has never sinned, He is the one and only acceptable sacrifice God the Father would accept to pay ransom payment for each of our sins. That is simply AMAZING isn't it? JESUS DID IT!! Seek Jesus Christ today and receive His FREE GIFT of eternal forgiveness and salvation.
