Please refund Perry. The area for the vr is too small first of all. The TV is too close and there are CLEAR guidelines when you install the vr about the area around you as a player. The TV broke because you didn't follow those guidelines. Not because Perry got scared and ran into it. Refund your friend his money and get a new TV via insurance or something.,0.4824,75
