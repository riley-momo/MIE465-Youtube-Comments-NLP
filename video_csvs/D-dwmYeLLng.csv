Parece que algo aconteceu, nos seus vídeos antigos eu via um brilho e um sentimento que me levava a sonhar a cada vídeo, agora, apesar da música divertida e do vídeo super produzido e como se houvesse uma tristeza no seus olhar. Espero que esteja bem. Fiquei encantada quando conheci sua arte e feliz por alguém ter esse tipo de sensibilidade, de qualquer forma não se afaste muito das suas raízes precisamos de uma base sempre, sei que a sua como a minha é Jesus, então te desejo tudo melhor.",0.4019,104
