"Can anyone explain me why american football has name ""football"" while it has little kicks with ball in game, and it doesn't require great technique, but just power in kick? Second, why ball is not round? You could easily play american football with round ball also. What's up whit that kind of ball. It is just not suited for foot-ball play. Third, why is touchdown more valuable than goal? I understand teams have to win area, but what kind of thrill you've got somebody does touchdown? I certianly have a thrill when someone scores goal in real football. Also, why in American football when scoring a goal, it is so acutally uninventive task, to kick ball straight to empty goal? You basically require no skills for it, just strong kick.  I think Americans got wrong name for this sport. It should be rather ""soft-rugby"" or similar. On the other side, Americans call real football ""soccer"". Funny, that ""soccer"" requries many much techique while playing and striking ball. And what's up with rugby? Many contries play it, it is firmer than NFL, but US sticks to American ""football"". So why don't Americans play at least rugby but rather sticks to American ""football"" and they are basically only in the world who play it?",0.9895,254

I'm a conservative democrat. I am not a Trump supporter, but I am still being vilified by this remark. 
Notice all of the late night hosts are men? Does he have a remark about that? It doesnt matter who you group together, its wrong. Hate speech is hate speech regardless of where you stand.",-0.944,100
