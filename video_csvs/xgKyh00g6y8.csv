"Rohypno tist..you have been completely jedi mind tricked.
It is our tax payer dollars that not only invents 'terrorism'..but they

religious kooks. False flags/government orchestrated terror is  a huge part
of history they do not want us to know about. Do yourself a favor along with the
rest of the brainwashed lemmings and stop believing the BS mainstream propaganda
filled narratives .

lazer weapons vs. a few men in white toyota trucks with outdated pea shooters..
