"Hi Todrick, 
I am not sure if you gonna read this, but it's a try. I wanted to tell you, that you are my hero. Your Music helped me through a lot of shitty days. Last Summer i was at your concert in cologne, with my mom. It was the First day in 2 years that my mom and I talked about the time she was in a coma. espcially one of your Songs helps me a lot in times of Mentally somatic pain and self-doubt. you make me feel like I  am not alone. I can identify with you, are non-straigt Person in a little town. ""It gets better"" became such a important song for my life that I want to tattoo These words on my body and it Would be a dream if you could write ""it gets better"" and send it to me. 

(please like this, that Todrick will See it) ❤❤❤❤",0.9579,178
