"""Go find the video lazy ass. You want everything handed to you?""
The old entitlement narrative doesnt apply here, context matters bud, nobody is demanding footage nor being overly critical over it. BUT
Most of us, probably people who value their time, have come to the same conclusion,
Since they are talking about the subject why not show some actual footage in the background while they speak or show a clip before or after speaking?
After all this is about the athletes and their performance yet like most years it turns into these reporters jockeying to get their own spotlight.",0.6048,112

"Almost all of you are idiots. 

Yes, figure skating is athletic, but he wasn't arguing that it wasn't. He was saying it was irrelevant. Which he is kind of right on. A sport that only gets spikes in people who watch it every four years is not that relevant of a sport for 3/4 of them. Meanwhile, football (soccer), the sport he is defending, is relevant yearly, due to the World Cup, Champions League, and many seasons around the world watchers by millions. Figure skating championships just aren't watched as much.

Insulting football to try to prove your point does nothing. Run Ronaldo Run never insulted the sport of figure skating itself. He was being a douche by calling it irrelevant, but that's besides the point. If you wanted to actual provide a good counter-argument, you would need to prove that football is irrelevant. Due to that being practically impossible, you guys steeped to the maturity of a third grader and started to insult the sport itself, something even he was mature enough not to do. 



Side note: @HenryDavidT, pretty sure you're thinking of the wrong football. Also, football is a very physical sport, and does require strength and physicality to play. So you're just wrong when you say it's for twats.",0.9608,245
