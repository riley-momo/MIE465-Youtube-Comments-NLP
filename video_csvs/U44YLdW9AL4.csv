The beach had a cover up rule only for when you enter the shops and foods on the beach, because there was some gang fight problem years before. In turn, they had to just kind of “ban” tattoos, but we’re talking about a full sleeve tattoo like mine. If you have a small tattoo, they won’t care. If you want to visit a Hot Spring, make sure they allow tattoos or you’ll have to wear a waterproof bandage over it. But, more and more hotels are starting to allow tattoos in the hot springs.
