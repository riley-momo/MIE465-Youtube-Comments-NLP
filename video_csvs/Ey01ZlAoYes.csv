How does the CEO of Pepsico think that women want Doritos to be quieter by talking about bringing out a woman only Dorito chip that's quiet. This commercial is what set off the firestorm. I don't get it but I think the CEO should step down. She clearly is not behind the PepsiCo brand and is trying to start dividing men and women with special only products.
