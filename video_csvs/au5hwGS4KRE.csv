Vikings fans defacing  an important statue and rallying on our steps makes US THE BAD GUYS? You can't forget that the Eagles fans just got revenge  against Vikings fans- you can't just forget that the Eagles just want payback for getting cheated out of a huge win? Plus, the Eagles fans that did what they did were a tiny fraction of the many Eagles fans in Pennsylvania. Not every one is like them. The players aren't. I am not. I'd say the same for the Vikings fans that disrespected us, but the way y'all are acting makes it seem like all of you are like that. The Vikings got steamrolled by the obvious better team. Stop being so bitter about it. Stop acting like the victim. You lose. Go home. Go home and watch the Eagles win in your own stadium.


EDIT - Honestly I want to apologize - this was just a salty rant from an exhausted Eagles fan. Its just a sport, its competetive, the Eagles and their fans are just excited to be in the Superbowl. This is directed towards the crybaby Viking fans- but I understand that not all of you are like that- not all of the Eagles fans are like that either.
