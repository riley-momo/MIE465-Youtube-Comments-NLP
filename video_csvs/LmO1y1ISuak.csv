I've hacked other meters similar to this to have an external power supply so they would read down to 0V. Handy when you want to measure the output of a Variac.  Never thought about hacking the purpose of the meter. If the thing really is a PIC chip or proper clone, it would be possible to bring it up on the ICE and maybe see what is going on.

"My first digital meter was the first one Fluke made; I still have it, although it no longer works.  At work, we use exclusively Fluke meters.  I picked up a hardware store Gardner-Bender digital meter for about $35 a few months ago.  It works, but it's *so* slow to update.  The display is hard to read, and it came with leads that are way too short.  A week or so ago, I picked up a used Fluke 87V on eBay for $160 (new, they're around $400) that had mangled leads and a blown fuse.  Spent another $35 on leads and a fuse, cleaned the gunk off the case with IPA, and it looks and works like new.  The max/min features are nice, and the hold, for when you can't see the leads and the meter at the same time.  And the backlight is an awesome feature.  No more squinting at low-contrast displays in dark corners.  Auto-off saves the battery, although it can be a bit annoying at times.  I downloaded a manual from Fluke's web site and found you can hold a button when you turn it on to disable auto-off for that session, so that's nice.  With the rubber boot, it's very durable, and everything just feels like quality.  Sometimes I just like to stare at it lovingly.  ;p",0.9721,259

Checked a lot of it and found nothing, checked the isolator itself, all ok, but customer said it was smelling (which I didn't argue about) so I turned it on with the panel open ( as you know there is no choice sometimes) to test things.  I found nothing so I turned it off, yes, you guessed it, this time one didn't go fully off and bingo!  Boy did it bloody hurt!  I always have a habit of touching circuits with my finger nail first, this way if it is live where it should not be your muscles naturally contract and your finger is pulled clear of the circuit.  DUH!  What did I learn, check it every time, isolator changed out and it was fine.  No, it took me a day of so to feel fine!  It came as a bit of a surprise, after that no one was allowed to work on three phase panels without someone else being there.

They are small enough and inexpensive enough just to have a set of three colour-coded meters, measuring the voltage between each phase and neutral, on every circuit.  Of course, even in single-phase situations, you might need multiple colours; a homebrew CHP plant might use blue for grid and solar, green for battery-fed inverter and red for generator.   It would also be useful to have a meter at the socket end of a long extension lead -- better than just providing an indication that the sockets were live, it would also show just how much the voltage sags when appliances are in use.

"l wilton Yeah, I'm probably just  worrying unnecessarily.  10% of 240 is 24, so anything between 216 and 264 is  still within 10% of nominal.   And digital stuff by definition either works ,or it doesn'a.

Would be kind of nice to try some extreme hacking on these  and create a general-purpose 3-digit display that can be used to display any arbitrary pattern .....  If the chips are FLASH based and have at least one I/O spare  (the ADC input that was used to measure the supply should become available)  it ought be possible just to reprogram them; if they are PROM based then it will require a whole new PCB design.",0.5279,127

This video is, if anything, the exact opposite of click-bait. Nowhere in the title or cover image was it even implied that these were DC. The image clearly shows 241 volts, which implies, if anything, that they are AC as anybody who knows anything about Big Clive knows he is in a country where 240 volts is the standard mains voltage.",0.87,103
would it be possible to do a quick follow up with the old reverse engineered clive schematic? or would that anonymous 14 pin chip be too big a roadblock? I’m not sure I understand how these work and I’d love to know!,0.598,49
