"India != Hindia.  While Karl Rock's  intentions are good, his video sends a wrong impression that India=Hindia.  Just to keep the record straight, India has 400+ native languages, and each ethnicity within India are proud of their mother tongue. India is equivalent to many nations put together - and all those nations like others to talk in ""their language"" (many India citizen do not know Hindi - in fact they see it as dominating/overpowering their language through legislative means).  No ""India passport holder"" can taste the linguistic/cuisine diversity of this political-entity (which is not a nation-state like many Western nations, China, Bangladesh etc - Those are Nation States, India is not).",0.8313,138
