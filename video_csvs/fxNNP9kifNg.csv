"No they aren't 1) That comment is ignorant, 2) Cgi is more expensive and hand drawn is cheap that is why movie theaters are full of 3d cartoons and tv shows are full of 2d characters 3) They have to design  the characters by hand before they make cgi models, they also do the storyboards completely by hand and the cgi characters match the storyboards exactly, 4) cgi is harder than 2d Animation 2d is childs play compared to cgi  seriously look at behind the scenes videos of movies like tangled or toy story 5) some 2d cartoons look terrible",0.8015,108

Except in the first few comics and the 80s cartoon where their personalities were sorta interchangable, Don is the brains, Ralph the emotional muscle, Mikey the clown, and Leo the leader. And they're changing the dynamic similar to voltron with switching around the lions and the pilot a a bit since the original. As for the art work I wanna wait till I see it in motion cause that is what counts. We won't really get a feel until the first episode for motion and writing. Nothing is sacred. But I feel weird about the parks and rec guy as Leo because he's in a duck tales. Blue seems to be his color hopefully he won't be a power ranger.",0.3626,158

Of course the new generation loves and enjoy cgi cartoons, but as an artist myself, and because ive grown with them, i will always prefer hand drawn over cgi cartoons
Ive experienced them all my life and like many other people, i still LOVE to watch them, and because i draw and will continue to draw until the day that i die...hand drawn cartoons will always be a million times better than any cgi cartoons in the world, im really sad to see them disappear, thats something that really gets to me
I wish we could have more of them, but sadly they are getting replaced by cgi...we get less and less of them, simply because hand drawn cost more to make and takes longer compared to cgi...but they also bring so much more imo",0.9758,211
