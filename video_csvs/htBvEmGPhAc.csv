"My friends, The Lord Jesus Christ is coming! Hallelujah!

Jesus loves you! 

I know you've heard that around, but you really have to know He truly loves you. 

The Word says that God so loves the world, He gave us His Only Begotten Son Jesus, that whoever believes in Him will not perish but have everlasting life. (John 3:16 paraphrased)

The Lord is not angry at you and neither does He hate you! 

Repent and put your faith in Jesus! 

He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him, He promises. (John 6:37 paraphrased)

So my friends, come to Him today. Call upon Him and you will be saved! (Romans 10:13)

He will wash away your sins, make you new and deliver you from the oncoming judgement headed to this earth. 

Shalom, my friends. I pray you make Jesus your Lord and Savior. All you need is mustard seed faith and sincere words from the heart.",0.9957,186

"Something about a month ago, I was picking my sister at the bus stop, as she returns from her job at late night so I go meet her there. On the way home, there were a couple of friends walking together in front of us, they made the same turn as we would do, and we saw them stopping and looking at a plastic bag in the ground, we didn't know what they were doing, but then again, people make weird things, when we got closer, as we eventually would, we came closer to the plastic bag, and we saw why they stopped. There it was, 4 puppies inside a plastic bag, on the dirt. It broke my heart. I ran to my house as I was walking with our dog, so that I could have both hands available, and we picked them up and brought them to our home. And God do they grow absurdly fast. We are just taking care of them until they don't rely on milk anymore as our house isn't big, we already have a dog and 2 cats. And the house is rented... So yeah",0.036,216
