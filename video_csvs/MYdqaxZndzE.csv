Brandon diesel what are you on about. Paying homage to other musical cultures isnt something to ve ashamed of.  There was 3 american performers and there are 13 awards in total 3 awards for international musicians which were won by americans  i wouldnt call that dominated would you? Its the brits the majority of the rewards can only be won by brits. Like at the american music awards the majority of awards can only be won by americans.

"Brandon diesel, good on you for not letting people disrespect your nation.

However, shouldn't you be concerned that there are a HUGE amount of US citizens who absolutely despise their own nation. Are you not aware of the SJW movement going on in your country? 

American SJWs are calling their own country a white supremacy, saying their own country is an oppressive force on the world, saying that your country cheated to get its wealth, saying the California deserves to be part of Mexico, saying that you should get rid of your military and your borders, and so on. I'd be more concerned about the actual Americans who hate your country, rather than foreign people hating on your country (which is pretty normal).

You've got your own bigger problems to figure out with your own citizens, so I find it amusing you come for the British.",-0.1691,163

Also, when the whole Macklemore/Kendrick controversy happened, MILLIONS of people were saying it was due to racism, and that Macklemore only won because he was white. So you either do not have a good memory, or you are lying. You can still find a lot of the tweets from when it happened. People weren't angry because they thought Macklemore was garbage, they were angry because they thought he won the award due to being white. Go on KTT (KanyeToThe), practically EVERYBODY who posts on that website was angry because they thought it was racist, not because Macklemore is garbage (although I'm sure most people think that too).

Truthfully, the reason Macklemore won was probably because he got two massive chart hits that year that people found catchy. It wasn't because he is white, and it wasn't because of his ""talent"" either.",0.9923,210

Damn was the highest selling album of 2017. As for Macklemore, even he knew that was undeserved, and that moment is one of few that shows the Grammys will rarely favour hip-hop and her artists. As to your point that no one would complain if wiz Khalifa won over Kendrick, that is impossible to say and would likely would never happen.",0.0243,97

"I guess it depends also on the qualities you really value in an MC too. I could probably name a few dozen MC's I subjectively 'prefer' over Kendrick but my opinion might change if I listened to all their ENTIRE body of work. For example if you think Kendrick is incredible, you might be arguing Tupac is the GOAT. On the other hand, I personally really respect raw lyricism and wouldn't put Tupac in the number 1 spot.",0.8012,86
"I like Kendrick a lot, I've been listening to him since I heard The Recipe with Dr. Dre.

HOWEVER, in the past whenever he's not won an award and a white person has won instead, the Internet (mainly Twitter) goes into melt-down claiming it's racist, and it's been damaging for some of the awards shows' brands in the past. So I don't think anybody will ever risk not letting him win an award now, and if he doesn't win they will make sure it's a another black person who beats him. For example, people were furious when Macklemore won an award over him, but I don't think people would have been as angry if Wiz Khalifa won an award over him.

I'm happy he wins awards, but on some level I'm wondering if some of them are due to these companies not wanting to risk being accused of racism. I think Kendrick himself knows this deep down, he's an intelligent guy.",-0.9596,180

"Jens Verner I'm not saying Kendrick isn't worthy of the awards, he certainly has the best combination of realness and mainstream appeal. However, talking about the Grammys especially, there were new talent worthy of a win such as Cardi B, Logic and SZA. That would've made for a better distrubution Whenever I see Kendrick sweep the Grammys it makes me think that the grammy committee is guilty of him losing to Mack back in 2014 and are making up EVERY time he's nominated",0.8717,89
"Jens Verner Logic's album as a whole in my opinion was not his best but it was his breakthrough single 1-800 that got nominated, I felt that was worthy of a grammy because it wasn't only hugely successful it also help people suffering with suicide. SZA is not a rapper but she was nominated for best rap/vocal collab with Travis Scott. Both rising artists. Cardi B still has a LOT to prove but for a mainstream single Bodak Yellow was very successful.",-0.9666,89

"Tucker Nevel, Kendrick is talented, moreso than Macklemore, but awards don't really have anything to do with how talented you are. There are lots of talented rappers who never even get nominated for an award.

Kendrick wins lots of awards nowadays, partially because of his talent, partially because of his commercial success, partially because the awards companies are scared of being called racist. And there are probably other factors which play in as well.

Also, ""reverse racism"" isn't a real thing. It's all just racism. Whether you discriminate against blacks, asians, eskimos, whites, arabs, jews, whatever, it's all just plain racism, and none of it is acceptable.",0.9719,131
