We left no survivors. 35 We took the livestock and plundered the towns. 36 The Lord our God let us capture all the towns from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Valley, and the city in the middle of that valley, all the way to Gilead. No town had walls too strong for us. 37 But we did not go near the territory of the Ammonites or to the banks of the Jabbok River or to the towns of the hill country or to any other place where the Lord our God had commanded us not to go.",-0.8945,278

"Some random thoughts on your Thanksgiving post: 1) While I agree the Pilgrim aspect is right, I tend to think of the Lincoln Aspect--that is Lincoln declared the third Thursday in November as a national day of  Thanksgiving during the Civil War. 2) Overindulgence and Veganism taken into consideration, my family and many others have limited our intake of food and yes, I and others have eaten no turkey for the holiday meal. 3)Turkey: I am sure you have been to Israel and what is the number one meat eaten there? Turkey! Why? It's cheap, lower in fat than beef, it aligns very well with Kosher dietary laws and easy to produce....what is second? Tuna. Have a nice broiled tuna with veggies......people still can be thankful. 

But yes...........I like the parade.....and the family meeting to be thankful and grateful...........

In short, Thanksgiving is what YOU and your family make of it.......oh, one other thing..... perhaps you and your family shouldn't volunteer at a homeless shelter to serve holiday meals....it's full of things you wouldn't like.......but then when we have volunteered at the shelters here in Tucson, the people there seemed to be grateful just to have a meal..........even the children. So, Volunteer!!!!! Make that a holiday tradition!!!!

I'm not a vegetarian yet (I'm working on that), but I understand that now that we have major control of our minds (unlike when we were hunters and gatherers which is the best example and argument people have for eating meat), there are other ways to satisfy our alimentary needs, besides killing animals on the behalf of it. The third reason is her opinion as having to experience and prioritize between several holidays and how tiring it is for her as a single-working mother of two. And finally, she's only saying WE SHOULD NOT CELEBRATE A GENOCIDE, because whether or not they had mercy and didn't kill every single indigenous person on the land they conquered, whether or not they gave the ones they didn't kill a piece of land and bit food to survive, it was a genocide and a historic event we should only rememeber to learn from it and not repeat it, not to celebrate it.",0.9062,240
