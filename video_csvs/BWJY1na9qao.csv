Then I had another dream that I was brushing my teeth and I was just spitting out blood so I went to look in the mirror and saw that my teeth had just started coming out from the gumline from me brushing them and I kept trying to push them back in but all it was doing was twisting them around and making them looser til they fell out 1 by 1. I heard someone say that when you dream of your teeth falling out, it means that you feel like you are losing control of something in your life.",0.4588,136
"I just found out that this really big corporate looking building by my house is a “church”. I always drove by it and thought it was some type of big private corporation because it is all gated off around the whole property except the front of the building. Once I found out it is a “church”, I looked at the surrounding area behind the gates more closely and there are actual houses (about 10 that I could actually see) behind the building in the back lot. I was so creeped out when I saw them. It feels like this “church” is some kind of cult like scientology but it’s not affiliated with scientology at all. The banner that they just put out, that made me realize that it’s a “church” says it is some type of worship center. What the actual fuck am I living next to? A few days later, we had a few boys, maybe 16 or 17, walking around our apartment complex in white button ups and dress slacks, like Mormons do, knocking on doors and talking about god. Thankfully I was out walking my dog at the time so that didn’t say anything to me except “hello”, but it made me wonder if they are from that “worship center”?",0.8594,250

"If you really want to know about Scientology, watch Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath. It’s in its second season right now but it follows Leah Remini, the actress, as she goes around and talks to former Scientologists she knew from when she was one and others that were big in the church who left and they discuss all of the hypocrisy and horrible things they saw in the church and the negative things that happened to them from leaving the church. You will never believe half of the fucked u shit that goes on behind those doors. Tom Cruise is a Scientologist and he is not allowed to be around anyone who is not one in his daily life, his maids, butler, driver, house manager, manager, lawyer, personal trainer, chef, basically anyone who has anything to do with his life in any capacity, including friends and family has to be a Scientologist to interact with him. The only exceptions are people he works with in movies but his contact with them is limited to filming only. He is not allowed to have access to the internet or read any kind of news that may have any kind of slanderous words about Scientology. He also has some crazy number of hours he has to spend doing work for scientology and studying the work of the founder. It’s something like 40 hours a week or more. You have to watch the show. I also think, since Katie left scientology, he is not allowed to have any contact with her and in order to see Zuri, he has to have one of his drivers pick her up and bring her to him and all contact and communication with Katie is done through someone else on his team. It is like that for everyone in Scientology. If you have a friend or family member who leaves Scientology and you stay in, you have to cut all ties with them or you will be seen as a trader and they will make you pay for these counseling sessions and some other thing that basically tries to brainwash you. The shit is fucking insane!",-0.9776,394
