This show will fail so hard. No Tommy plus they will turn it into another Trump Bashing mania instead of focusing what made the show great which was the writing. Martin did tons of drugs back then he does not have the energy as much he does in the 90's anymore. Pam looks great but i doubt Cole would want to be part of the show i think he hates Martin and Tisha and Martin together again after the Sexual assault claims... man what a world we live in,-0.9114,95
This situation is real stupid because there's no practical reason to bring back Martin show. All this does is put more pressure on the cast to be more funnier than they were 20 years ago and you can't even do it properly because Thomas Ford have passed on.
