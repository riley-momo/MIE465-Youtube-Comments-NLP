"Just got back from seeing a ""pre-screening"" and I really like this movie.  It really captures your attention and the characters draw you in.  I would give it an 8/10 and liked it much better than Call Me By Your Name.  I found the ending nice but thought it was a little exaggerated like the film Grease (Danny and Sandy) with everyone all happy at the end that the 2 were finally together in a tacky sing-y/dance-y way.   Other than a Hollywood sweet but still sappy ending it was worth the money and the message it sends about inclusiveness, acceptance and forgiveness is a message worth imparting on a world that needs to make room for one another with a supportive embrace despite differences.  If I were to change one thing about the end it would be to make the unification of Simon and Blue more about them alone and not with their peers cheering them on. Ok that's my review.",0.9876,176
