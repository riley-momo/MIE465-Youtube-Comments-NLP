"I really hope this movie sticks to the unconventional side of things like the first. It seems every movie like this nowadays has one character that needs to ""do the right thing"" and be the moral barometer. And as one can predict, the moral one always wins. But not in the first Sicario. I was pleasantly surprised when the ""bad guys"" won. Much more realistic and unpredictable. So I really really hope they keep to the brutal truth of how the real-world is and how it operates (ie. the good/moral characters don't always prevail).",0.9476,111

Nick S well for plot reasons it looks like Del Toro is hitting a big up in a cartel and he might not want the heat to fall back to the US or CIA or whatever.  I think they want the cartels to war against each other and destroy each other so they are disguised like a rival gang and hitting a big figure from another gang.  A clean assassination would look too suspicious so lighting him up with the bump fire would fit the MO,-0.8275,88

"This trailer feels 'off' somehow.. The first movie was slow, gritty and tense. That and the violence felt raw because it was juxtaposed to extended quiet moments. Which was because Denis Villeneuve knows how to create tension and mood.
