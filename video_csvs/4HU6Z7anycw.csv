"See I love this adorable little buddy booper here but this doesn't really help me with real spiders. It's different from person to person but for me it's the way that spiders move and how they look in the face. Lucas looks realistic-ish and some jumping spiders look very similar to him but there's something about spiders that make me reflexively scrunch up when I look at them. I can kill one if I see one no problem I'm not one of those people who has a heart attack and screams, but I still hate to look at them. Spiders in movies and games don't even bother me even when realistic, they're even cool usually. Except the group in The Hobbit they nailed those ones, but even then not as much. Does anyone else have aracnaphobia in a similar way? I'm curious to know.",-0.9564,155
