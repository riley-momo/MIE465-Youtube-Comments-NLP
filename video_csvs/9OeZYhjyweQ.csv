"Well I was driving during heavy bar hours and I picked up this yound man who was obviously intoxicated, I was kind of worried  of letting him inside of my car but I needed all the rides I can get. Long story short, It was a long ride to his destination (at least a $20+ ride) and before we got 3 miles from his destination, he vomits outside my window, apologizes, then stumbles into the night. Obviously I was pissed off (and gave him a shitty review), but lucky me the mess he made was pretty much outside my door, so I didn't give a thought to look inside at my Interior. Immediately I found a 24hr self serve car wash and started to clean this stranger's inability to hold his booze, till I noticed the real reason why he ran off without saying goodbye. On my floor near the back right side where he was sitting was at least over 2 grams of cocaine spilt all over my black interior floor. Lucky me I found vacuums! 
  I guess this wasnt one of my emotionally damaged passengers but was my funniest story, and yes I decided to let the kid go without notifying law enforcement. So  cheers to you person whom can't handle his booze and waste his money on drugs without taking them!",0.7831,247
