That is life, cannot be better each and every time a Superbowl comes around i did not see to many people at the Superbowl giving it a thumbs down.

The only disappointing thing that i could see about the half time show was no song with Chris Stapleton that would have been very good to see that at the ending of the set.

But could have left out the Prince tribute ??????????? 

People get to political about music in general.
The way i look at music.
 Enjoy the feel you get from listen to songs that you love.
But sing your song and finish to many people put to much worship to a singer / band ??????
Just enjoy it for what it is and move on,  just to many great singers / bands / songs in our lives to worship one.

I love how he moved around the whole arena and engaged the WHOLE crowd and even got in there with the people. Hardly was he in one place so everyone in the arena could enjoy. Tribute to Prince was absolutely beautiful. Turning Minneapolis purple with the Prince symbol. GENIUS!  
Awesome! Don't know what the issue is and why people didn't like it. The crowd absolutely loved it and they should be the judge. To be able to move around like he did, dance, sing and everything else he did and to sound great (yes at times, and no doubt he will agree, a little off. SO would you if you moved around and dance and sung like he just did!) Are they aware of the extent this man and his team went to for this? How many people were employed for this? 
I guess some people what an artiest to remain on the stage or move to the field then back on the stage. With the people behind missing out.
