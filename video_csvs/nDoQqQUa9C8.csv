"AntsCanada it became so obvious to me that you do all of these ""tradgedies"" videos intentionly because of how much more you care about your subs, sales and other channels, and how you ""found"" decapitated ants, the tomb raiders ""mysteriously contracted mites"" and died, even though you handeled mites before, quite easily I might add. But regardless of what I say you will still do the same thing, time and time again and your fans will still just:""ant luv 4 live h8r go kys (has seaziure he calls dabbing on dem hsters)""
