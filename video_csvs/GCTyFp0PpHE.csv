"Only a *bit* crazy? Dude...props to you for being able to hold a coherent thought in your head upon completion of this production.

I have never seen the like. It's like the urban legend of Leonardo da Vinci spending 20 years painting the Mona Lisa a few minutes a day in the afternoon when the lighting was good with  a single bristle brush. Or maybe  like the story of Carl Loeffler, the math professor who developed 6000 combinations for the game of bingo so there wouldn't be multiple winners, but went bonkers as a result of his mental exertions...or so I'm told.

So precise. So harmonious. So exacting. If the universe consisted of this single routine, support for Intelligent Design would be unanimous.",0.8805,141
