Got an idea for a commercial. Have a commercial where someone walks up to a mirror and there’s a monster behind him. whenever he turns around to check (the monster is only in the mirror) the monster would get closer While still promoting the app. (The monster is only in the mirror though),0.3612,62

TurboTax turbo tax sucks my girl did her taxes last week for the first time she did them on her own with the same information as every year with our young 2 daughters and supposedly it's free turbo tax gives you a option to 30$ or free she chose free and now she under investigation and getting oddit by the i.r.s we never had a problem with our usual tax person! She just tried to save some money so now she has to wait like 2 or 3  month to get her tax returns!

Bam, there it is, there's the problem, at least as I *could* imagine it.
