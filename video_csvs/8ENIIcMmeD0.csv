"Hello Nikita. You are just the cutest being, woman I’ve ever seen. I’m sorry to comment like this but I have the hugest favor. Which you are more than welcome to ignore or reject. I wanted to ask if you could share this go fund me link gf.me/639t . It’s not for me it’s for my momma. My sister died in a car accident the 15th of this month and I’m trying to help my momma out. She can’t work under this condition and I can’t afford to help her keep her house. So I’m just asking everyone if they could share and who ever wants to donate I’d highly appreciate it. I want my mom to keep the house my sister lived in. So she can keep my sister close even if she’s gone. Thank you for reading this and I love you for being so kind and sweet.",0.9874,182

Kier Kevin Hi. I know she probably won’t get to you but always stay strong. There will be times that are hard but know that you can and will get through it. Find a positive outlet and focus on yourself. Find someone to talk to. Find a passion in your life that makes you happy. Surround yourself with people who love and accept your uniqueness. Don’t be afraid to be yourself. It’s ok to be different. It’s ok to be YOU! ❤️,0.9881,101
