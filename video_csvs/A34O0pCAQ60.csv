And it’s not exactly the same teams, imo Ohio State shouldn’t have went last year, just like I feel bama shouldn’t have gone this year. Bama only went because of $, fsu was suppose to be good and if they were that would have helped them. But they played poop teams and were third in their conference. That’s my point if Bama beat 3 top 15 teams then lost to Auburn, I’d be completely fine with Bama being over Ohio State",0.6997,115

You fail to see the validity of reasoning so I’m assuming you lack the knowledge to make counter points. Ucf unlike bama and Ohio State won their games so yes they deserve to be over everyone so I don’t get why you tried to make an argument out of that. You keep bringing up previous seasons like it has any bearing over this season. And from this season all the games that Georgia and Bama have lost they were favored to win. So that entire point was invalid. And now I’m getting will Bama lose, which is now your argument since “it’s highly unlikely Alabama or Georgia get blown out like what happened to Ohio State” (saying both teams are gonna lose just not a blow out) so since you believe both teams are gonna lose why do you believe they should be in there then.",0.8718,188

If Ohio would've had a closer game to Iowa and Oklahoma I would imagine we wouldn't be having this conversation. Alabama hasn't been crushed by anyone this year like that. We lost to Auburn but it wasn't by much in an extremely hostile environment. Hopefully we can pull of a win but it will be tough to beat this Clemson team.

I mean do you really want that, or just pretend you do to look tough? 31 to 0. They beat bama on last play. I guess what I’m saying is don’t talk about it be about it. The committee put you in last year, and you embarrassed them and yourselves. It appears that some of you would be happy to get thumped again but the committee not so much. Iowa thumped you. Oklahoma thumped you. So you got thumped by unranked team. You got thumped by a team that’s in playoffs so that shows the committee your worth. But but but we are big 10 champs. Like penn state was last year??????? You cry cry cry and hate bama but in the south your not even a blimp on the radar. Look up national title wins in past 15 years SEC. hate on bama that’s fine they are a dynasty so easy target. You should thank them for getting the 4th spot saved you another Clemson beat down. Have you guys ever beaten Clemson? Lost a coach playing them and a bunch of games. Will bama beat Clemson? It could go either way but it will be close and entertaining.

"Jake M everyone was talking about last year game which has some impact, for the most part, same player, system and more. 2012 has almost no impact on this season. that why I only when back with Iowa 3 year of trash bowls. so why bring up Clemson? why do you think Oklahoma is good? they have a hard time with teams like Baylor, Iowa State and Kansas State (which Vanderbilt showed they are in the same ballpark of these teams if not better). and saying these teams like Florida State are trash does not help Ohio State case if they did not beat anyone better non-conference.",0.3158,120

Jake M iowa state was not the same team later on in the year. If they played iowa now they would beat Iowa without question. And iowa state didnt lose 55-24 to them. Stop trying to justify the loss. You could do that if they lost a close one but 55-24 is ridiculous to a non ranked team,-0.5888,62
"Jake M you obviously don't understand the concept off predict the future by using rhythms of the past. you keep trying to turn it around and say why the SEC should not be in. then gave no rational reason why Ohio State should be in. here the main reason why SEC on top. it just more player in the South East to the % of schools they can go to. it put schools like Ohio State at a disadvantage. just look at the NFL player per capita you see Louisiana, South Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida, Alabama make the most NFL player per 100,000 by a long shot. when you have a state like Georgia with 99 NFL player and only 2 bowl football schools vs Ohio 80 NFL player and 7 bowl schools. it hard to say a team in Ohio that is 11-2 is better than a team 11-1 in the SEC or plays better teams.",0.802,171
"Jake M,  i will make it simple for you ""Ohio State did not get in because they lost 2 games!!!"" stop making up stuff like money. big-10 is over rank, that why you see more ranks play in the regular season and can't win in the bowl. last 10 bowl season big-10 only has 2 years where they were positive vs SEC 8 years. ""what happened in the past doesn’t define what happens this season"" then UCF would have knocked out Ohio State. from the past, I can tell you there is only 2 match-up not in favor of the big-10 this year (should easily go 6-2) but somehow they find a way to lose the bowl and get (4-4). also from the past, it's highly unlikely that Alabama or Georgia get blown out like what happened to Ohio State.",0.3072,169

John Johnson when you lose by 31 points its not a fluke. Also psu was leading pretty much that entire game  off of osu turnovers but got conservative and osu came back. They pretty much handed the game to Wisconsin by turning the ball over but Wisconsin has no offense. If they played like that against any of the teams in top 4 they get blown out. Jt Barrett is holding that offense back and the committee thought bama would put up a better game. Also bamas defense will be fully healthy when they play clemson,0.9654,101

At the end of the day though, the bigger issue is not which team made the top 4, but how long are we gonna wait until they just start taking 8 teams. 5-8 all deserve a shot IMO. Let's let the championship be won or lost on the field, not in some 13 person committee.",0.8381,131

"as a buckeyes fan i truly appreciate our players and coaches had worked hard the whole year and won all those game we looked forward to wining, penn state, michigan state and michigan, etc, plus finally they brought back big 10 championship of the year back to columbus. of course no need to mention what they learnt from those losses.
buckeyes' big loss to iowa became an excuse for alabama sneaking in. everybody can always make a case for anything debatable. but for that specific game, i still think coach meyer and all his coaching staff did trying their best for a win although it turned out other way around. i believe they risked a gamble for a big comeback win as they did against penn state and chose being more aggressive instead of trying to minimised their loss but luck didn't go their way. yeah, you could say putting haskins in and i ever thought the same, but you have to admit jt is a much more stable qb than any other red shirt qbs at least for now and undeniable leader of the team and we do need a strong leader in the field to make it right in that difficult situation. who knows whether putting haskins in could have made a difference. anyway we have to say we do need a more powerful offense to be really on the top if we ever dare to challenge everyone anyone for the national title again.
i feel bad for college football playoff selection committee choosing a team being conservatively stuck to a soft schedule as well as the fact that team was gifted the top spot in the rank almost every year based on their own subjective assumption that the team 'shoulda-coulda-woulda' be the best one. especially this year the message of the decision sending out to those potential playoff contenders is to schedule cupcake opponents to maintain a better winning record instead of trying to bring better, competitive, exciting and enjoyable games to the fans and audience.
i feel bad for our players that this was thrown to your faces so quick just after you won a big one. i admire what you achieved this year and enjoy your moment and as i said don't let all these carry you away too far. we'll have another game to make a better finish of the year. always being prepared and win what really matters.
