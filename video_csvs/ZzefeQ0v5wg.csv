"DON'T USE AR EMOJI, AND OTHER VIDEO ANIMATING ""FEATURES"" 
The whole point of these tools, which have felt awkward (like, really? this is a feature worth it's own segment?) since day one at the Apple launch event, is to get you to spend time letting the phone build a 3d mesh of your face, entirely in service to the surveillance industry. Yup. They do it with a fish tunnel in the Dubai airport. The more time you spend with it, with various makeup, accessories, and hats, the more you'll be able to be spotted by AI in the future. Worry about it or not.. it's your dime.

I say this can any android that can do 4K is limited to just 5min 4K video recordings, even the new galaxy s9 and s9+ plus can do 4K at 60fps is limited to just 5min, so that’s holding back youtubers cuz android phones isn’t a good enough camera for making 4K videos for their YouTube shows when you can’t record more than just 5 mins at a time",0.0258,96
