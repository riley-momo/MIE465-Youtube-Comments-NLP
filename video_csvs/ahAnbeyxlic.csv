"@ chels T Wrong!!! If you are going to quote history... get your facts right It was the the PORTUGUESE who started the exportation of Africansin the 15th c, then the Spanish and the Dutch then the English and French. Actually  the first people taking slaves in history were back before Egyptian times. Babylon was a place full of slaves Whenever a war occurred, prisoners were taken as slaves in most lands. Arabs used slaves in the 7th c. The Romans used slaves so did the Greeks. Southern and Eastern Europe continued to use slaves well into the 16th century.  However, trading in slaves as opposed to just using them as unpaid servants expanded in the 16th c.  as a result of world exploration and the resultant  opportunistic greed that occurs when new places and resources are found.  Also, modern day slavery is rife, so don;t think that only one group has ever suffered from it,  FYA...... it was the Quakers in the U.S and in Britain who sparked off the Abolitionist Movement",-0.9637,196

You cannot speak for most of the people of the UK - you have no idea of the true opinions of the population of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 

Again you're talking about someone lacking morals, who's marrying into the family. 
When I've provided so many examples in previous posts, of the BRF displaying no morals whatsoever. You conveniently choose to disregard that, because let's face it, the truth hurts, Hugh!  

""Gold-diggers"" latch on to a wealthy man and use them to provide them a privileged and lavish lifestyle - Meghan already had a privileged and lavish lifestyle before she even met Harry.

"Well, I was proud to be an American when President Obama was in the White House. I lost that pride on January 20th, 2017. I am once more, proud to be an American. Thanks Meghan for making Prince Harry look like the happiest man in the world. I have desperately wanted to erase the image of the little broken-hearted ginger prince walking behind his mother's funeral cortege for 20 years. Of the ladies he has dated, you are the only one to truly make his eyes sparkle like his mother's. Now, I am going to ask the people of Britain to PLEASE give her time to acclimate to the Royal Protocol.These are things that I have heard ""experts"" say and some comments other people have made on different sites about her. If you don't mind, I'd like to say something to those people in case they come upon my comment.
 1) So, she doesn't wear pantyhose, personally, I really couldn't tell and they are normally worn to give a hint of color to a woman's  legs who are gingers like me or to help hold in a little tummy and to streamline the look of a dress, no pantylines. Ladies, help me out here with the men going mental and using ""warmth"" in conjunction with hose. If there's one thing hose do not do, they don't provide warmth.Tights that have some thickness to them help, but nothing like pants. I invite all the male etiquette and royal protocol police to put on a pair of hose, heels & dress, go stand outside for 10 minutes and see how warm they feel.
2) I have heard her criticized for wearing a white coat after Labor Day. That rule went out the window years ago here in the States. 
3) She's criticized because her hair is askew, & not tied up in a tight bun, seriously? She's not like the Dutchess of Cambridge, she's not going to be queen. Plus, her hair, while beautiful, most likely has a slightly different texture to it because she is bi-racial. My African-American friends taught me a great deal about ""good hair"". And, Meghan definitely has ""good hair"", but she's a free spirit, so she may never wear it in a tight bun, especially at events such as this one. But, when it is a formal occasion, I promise, you won't find a hair out of place. 
4) She's used to signing autographs and taking selfies with her fans, so it may take a few mistakes before she gets that down perfectly.
5) One person on another site said she purposefully didn't curtsey to Her Majesty the Queen on Christmas. And, that's not true. She looked scared to DEATH, I am sure she's practiced and I am sure that Kate has shown her how to curtsey. She was very nervous, looked like she was standing much to close to the step behind her and was unable to put her leg completely behind the other. Well, Kate forgot to curtsey to the Queen when leaving her wedding, the world didn't end. She'll learn how to do it properly.
6) So, she's a feminist. The same person complaining about the curtsey said that she was being disrespectful to the Queen by being a feminist. That statement is ludicrous. The Queen is the epitome of a feminist. She's had to deal with very pissy men in positions of authority and stood her ground for her country and the Commonwealth. And, she's done it with dignity, class, grace, beauty and determination. While, she's ""merely"" Head of State and doesn't have a vote in governmental affairs, she has made so many women feel powerful, feel emboldened while still being all woman. I don't know of one American president who could've  maintained not only his own composure but maintain control over the horse he was riding as she did during the Trooping the Colors ceremony when someone fired 3 shots. They were blanks, but she didn't know it at the time. She is the ultimate feminist.
7) the pre-nup and a ""screaming fit""? A pre-nuptuial agreement protects both Harry and Meghan. If she doesn't renounce her US citizenship, then she will have to pay taxes not only on her income, but THEIR income. Should she receive expensive gifts from foreign dignitaries as Princess Diana did, that's a type of income and taxable. Harry's monies from his mother may be protected but, the income they will receive from the Duchy of Cornwall would be taxable in the US as well as Britain. So, I truly doubt there was any screaming going on because it's to protect both of them from double taxation. She'll still have to pay taxes on her monies, I think that I have heard $5 million US dollars but the show she was a star on has been on air for 7 years, it passed the 100th episode mark which means it can now go into syndication all over the world. She will receive money from the re-runs of the show for however long it is aired somewhere on the planet. And, she'll have to pay taxes on that income unless she renounces her citizenship. At this moment, I don't think she will do that, she wouldn't want to be perceived as ""abandoning ship"" even though she's no longer supposed to voice a political opinion. That will be the hardest thing for her, not being able to express her opinions on the crap going on over here.
OKAY, just had to get that nastiness off my chest. I am simply so happy to see Harry with a sparkle in his eyes. She'll learn how to adopt to the tradition and protocol of the Royal Family. And, she'll add some extra fun as well. I hope that she and Kate will become great friends. Because, someday, Catherine, Queen Consort of England will need someone who knows what it's like to live in a fish bowl.
And, my best advice to those who oppose having the man who won the rigged US presidential election, keep opposing, protesting and fighting to keep him out of your country. If he MUST come, keep him as far away from the Royal Family as possible. We are still in the infant stage of longevity of countries and we don't have a great deal of protocol, but what we do have, he doesn't feel applies to him. He would most likely kiss the Queen on the cheek, then try to break whomever has to shake his hand. And, we just learned that he was committing adultery with a porn star a couple of months after his wife gave birth to his youngest son, Barron. She was paid over a $100,000.00 US dollars for her secrecy. I certainly wouldn't want him in the same state as my grandmother. I apologize for the longest comment, perhaps of all time, but I was going to explode if I didn't respond to the things that I have read about Meghan on other sites. Someday, I hope to visit your country and I definitely want to see Cardiff Castle. It's magnificent.

Good for you, i can't say i give a fuck about who you care for, or your opinion of the Royal family. Most of the people of the UK love the Queen and she has a 75% approval rating from her subjects so i guess your in the minority. Markle is a lying gold digger with no morals. God save the Queen.",0.9428,70
"monalisasmile
I know in the last opinion poll done the Queen had a 75% approval rating and markle was at 19% so i guess someone has an idea of the opinions of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I told you the truth about markle and you're the one who doesn't like it.",0.8121,56
"monalisasmile
You have two things right, i am a royalist and i dislike markle with a passion. I'm not being negative i am simple pointing out the truth, that is there for all to see. But you and the other sheep would rather believe all the propaganda being spewed out by markles pr company and the palaces press officers. Fact she is a cheat she did cheat on her first husband with a ice hockey player, she was still going out with her chef boyfriend while dating Harry, she let her dad go bankrupt despite being a millionaire and saying to interviews how much she loves him, she lied about not knowing anything about the royal family and Harry, there are pictures of her sitting outside Buckingham palace and she owned the book Diana. This woman is a fake and a fraud and it's about time the sheep on here woke up to the fact.",-0.8934,166
