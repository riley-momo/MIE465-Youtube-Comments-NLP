"If you made it here, you can enjoy little things that matter. And worry about little things, cause all those pieces make this big puzzle we call life, fit together. And believe in yourself, and those around you. Because sometimes they dont believe in themselves and you could make the biggest difference in the world, worrying over those little things in life. Dont sweat the small stuff, make it meaningful, and always look out for those who have stumbled. They could really use a helping hand. One love, one heart, one mind, one life. Pass it on.",0.9132,115

"lyrics:

Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking

Here's a simple song
It's never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking

It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Well I know its not been easy
But easy ain't worth singing about

Hey I know, I know
Time goes slow
But it's always running out

Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking

Here's a simple song
Never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking

It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Well I know it's far from simple
But simple ain't worth worrying about

Hey I know, I know
It's time to go
I think I keep on finding everything seems to be about timing

Here's a simple song
Won't stop the rain from coming down
Or your heart from breaking

Just a simple song
Never gonna turn this day around
Stop the earth from shaking

It's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to

Oh it's just a simple song
Nothing right or wrong
You can sing along if you want to",-0.9446,227
