‼️TRL is just using the twins‼️


I love the twins, but im really not happy on how TRL uses them. Ik people are going to come attack me saying they wanted to see BH but TRL cut them off, even though I really don’t know them, they shouldn’t have cut them off. They’re supposed to include them if they’re going to use their name. 

It’s obvious the twins aren’t even happy on TRL. they just want views because they know the dolan Twins have a large fan base. I was so happy they got to go on a show like this, but they set so much limits to them it bothers not only to me but to so many other people. 


If you read through all of this, thank you. I really don’t like TRL for using the twins and for cutting BH off.",-0.8842,185
