I've made a full scale of the x wing and flown her, Millenium Falcon to scale ""but no flight"" as she is too big and would have been even bigger if she had rounded corridors... Voyager scaled to within 260 meters ""in dock"" length. Loved your build, it brought a smile to my face indeed.",0.875,103

Really nice ship you got there but it would be even super duper awesome if it could really fly and shot actual laser beams.  

Shit with a fleet of those we could take over the planet, minus the storm trooper suits unless they were bullet and or laser proof.    

Think about it we could rule the solar system and the universe.  lol   Just kidding awesome job with the tie fighter.   Looks like a nice place to hangout in and have a few drinks with that special female star wars fans.    

the BB-9E droid reminds me of the V.I.N CENT and OLD BOB droids from Disney's The BlackHole movie of 79.  Have you ever made anything else from any other movie besides Star Wars?",0.9802,177
