"I’ve been hoping for so long to finally see Taylor Swift and James Corden together.

James has brought up the feuds that Taylor has had with Kim/Kanye and Katy Perry quite a bit by mentioning it at least a handful of times in his show by having other guests perform skits about it (like the “soap opera” skit with John Stamos) and then James making jokes and especially how James has done a lot of interviews and skits and etc with Katy Perry and they spoke about the feud but James has never said anything negative about Taylor.

The reason why the fact that Taylor hasn’t been on his show it’s pretty strange is because James had starred in his movie called “One Chance” back in 2013 which was based on a true story of Paul Potts and I believe really got his name out there and led to him booking bigger roles and then getting his own Late Night show 2 years later. Anyways, Taylor Swift wrote and recorded an original song for the film called “Sweeter than Fiction” which was beautiful. Although the movie wasn’t well known, it was very inspirational.

So I thought for sure that as soon as James got his own show, Taylor would be one of the first guests based on the fact that they worked together. Maybe that’s a silly assumption but I’ve been dying to at least see them interact or talk about the movie since Taylor was involved in it. So seeing them finally be in a skit together even if it was small and with more than just them two, was pretty cool. The next step NEEDS to be carpool karaoke or even better, a game of “spill your guts or fill your guts” with James and Taylor. Taylor would get asked so many personal questions though, she would have to eat everything. 😂",0.9927,354
