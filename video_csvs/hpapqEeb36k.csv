"Dear Mr. Ysac,
I became a fan of your videos and your wangjangling skills, i have been attempting to grow such skills for a while now, it's a long process and a hard skill to master.
But i find that such art have taught me a lot about patience, love and life. It teach you how to love the object you are wangjangling, when to wangjangle more and when to wangjangle less, when to stop and when to be just be gentle.
I am taking it slowly by trying to master my wang on and wang off training. 
I live in Egypt but at the end of this year i'll be heading to the far East where i have heard they have mastered the wangjangling art for centuries basically beacuse it's the art used to make soy sauce there.
I hope i find a sensei that will take me under his wings and help me develope my wangjangling....i hope one day if i am set out to the US that i will meet you.

Sincerely yours,
A wangjangler enthusiast",0.979,195

And I had this constant unsettling anxious feeling, and nothing felt genuine. She even said I love you during that period. I hurt, I was anxious, I was terrified with anticipation about what it would be like without her, and I was in this really fucking weird headspace for two weeks. When I felt like shit I watched these videos, constantly. I ended up binging every single one, and now whenever I hear the intro I get this sort of comforting feeling. Which is completely subjective and circumstancial of course. So thanks for the laughs, knowledge and odd comfort",0.3847,178
