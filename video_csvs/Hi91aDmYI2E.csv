"Crowder debunks the Islamist NYT!

""Jerusalem is just as holy to Judaism as Islam""

First, the 1922 Palestine mandate had Jews containing everything and TransJordan for Arabs. The Arabs couldnt even stand the 1948 concession. In the Torah they believe the temple is one of the requirements for salvation in the future, much like Islam believes Hajj to Mecca is required for salvation. In Islam its mentioned 0 times in the Quran and 500+ in Torah. It's only mentioned in the Hadith as a ""far away mosque"" and then guessed to be Jerusalem when they didnt even bother naming it.

""Every administration said Jerusalem must be decided by peace talks""

"Seek Truth Palestinians were conquered and converted by Arabs in 650ad.. Palestinians are native to the Levant these European converts are not,they're nothing but land thieves.. The origin of the Ashkenazi Jews, who come most recently from Europe, has largely been shrouded in mystery. But a new study suggests that at least their maternal lineage may derive largely from Europe.Though the finding may seem intuitive, it contradicts the notion that European Jews mostly descend from people who left Israel and the Middle East around 2,000 years ago. Instead, a substantial proportion of the population originates from local Europeans who converted to Judaism, said study co-author Martin Richards, an archaeogeneticist at the University of Huddersfield in England. Richards and his colleagues analyzed mitochondrial DNA, which is contained in the cytoplasm of the egg and passed down only from the mother, from more than 3,500 people throughout the Near East, the Caucusus and Europe, including Ashkenazi Jews.

The team found that four founders were responsible for 40 percent of Ashkenazi mitochondrial DNA, and that all of these founders originated in Europe. The majority of the remaining people could be traced to other European lineages.",0.4019,213

The large amount of Ashkenazi Jews came from Israel and mixed in with the European population. The majority of Ashkenazi Jews are genetically traced back to the region through dna testing. They have distinct physical traits which set them apart from other Europeans. Hundreds of thousands also came back from all over the Middle East like from Yemen and Iraq. It doesn't matter anyway. Israeli law allows religious Jews including converts to claim citizenship in order to build a Jewish country that they fought for and won fair and square.

"The reason why Trump's acknowledgment of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is so powerful is because it's the Truth, with a capital T! In other words, the power of the Holy Spirit underpins the very acknowledgement itself. It therefore follows that any nation that says otherwise is now being marked for destruction in God's wrath! With 1.5 billion Arabs in a blind rage over Trump declaring Jerusalem the Capital of Israel, our not being here for Christmas is now on a fast-track to becoming a reality!!!

""...Jerusalem will be trampled by Gentiles until the times of the Gentiles are fulfilled."" [Luke 21:24] Even though Israel recaptured Jerusalem, in the 6 day war, in 1967. The UN, which represents all the Christian and Muslim Gentile nations, is still trampling Jerusalem by not acknowledging the City as the capital of Israel. Note the definition of to trample: To treat with contempt. "" synonyms: ride roughshod over, disregard, set at naught, show no consideration for, treat inconsiderately, treat disrespectfully, take for granted, encroach on, infringe."" This is how the UN have been treating Israel, with regards to Jerusalem, for the last 50 years! A ""time"" in Scripture means 1 Year. More than ""a time"", therefore, means more than a year. Since 1967, 50 times [that is, 50 Years] have been fulfilled. The times of the Gentiles [i.e. the UN] is up. They're about to be judged! This is why President Donald Trump acknowledged Jerusalem as the capital of Israel on the 6th of December 2017. It simply couldn't have been done before now because the times of the Gentiles had to be fulfilled first. We already know what's going to become of all the nations that make up the UN. It's not good. They're digging there own graves. 

""Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of drunkenness to all the surrounding peoples, when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem. And it shall happen in that day that I will make Jerusalem a very heavy stone for all peoples; all who would heave it away will surely be cut in pieces, though all nations of the earth are gathered against it. In that day,” says the Lord, “I will strike every horse with confusion, and its rider with madness; I will open My eyes on the house of Judah, and will strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, ‘The inhabitants of Jerusalem are my strength in the Lord of hosts, their God.’ In that day I will make the governors of Judah like a fire-pan in the woodpile, and like a fiery torch in the sheaves; they shall devour all the surrounding peoples on the right hand and on the left, but Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her own place—Jerusalem."" [Zech.2:2-6] 

The UN is made up of Christian as well as Muslim nations.The Christian nations are Roman Catholics. Pope Frances, who speaks on their behalf, doesn't acknowledge Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He is therefore bringing God's wrath down on 1.2 billion Roman Catholics worldwide. As part of the UN, all the Christian nations the Pope represents are going to be destroyed too! The UN gathered together to vote against Israel's legitimate claim over Jerusalem. They've have now locked themselves into making mad decisions that's going to bring about their immediate and swift destruction.",-0.9367,668
"The solution is simple. Jews need to let go of their jewishness/judaism and arabs need to let go of their arabness/islam/christianity.

Jerusalem falls under this promised land. Another thing most of the current so called jews in israel are not direct descendants of the ancient israel but just a few. same case with the palestines(philistines).
Jerusalem is a holy city,GOD is one,that is the reason all major religions recognize jerusalem as a holy place, this is quite symbolic.
