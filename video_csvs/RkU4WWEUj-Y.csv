"I was a developer on Microsoft Bob from close to the beginning through the 2.0 version that was just months from release.

There was a lot to the program that is not well known. This article, http://www.technologizer.com/2010/03/29/microsoft-bob/, does a pretty good job explaining some of the history.

Some of the things that were first seen in Bob are common place today. For example, all of the controls were animated and had hover-over feedback as well as subtle sounds for the actions. The speech balloons were implemented using a Windows’ window object, but Windows did not support non-rectangular windows at the time, so I worked around that limitation and the implementation was backported into Windows after Bob shipped. Something else you might not realize is that most of the applications were written in Visual Basic. Those apps used a lot of custom controls that I wrote. Prior to Microsoft Bob I had done the user interface for Visual Basic and had done a lot work on custom controls.",-0.5348,182

So in a weird way, I kind of feel the point was for it to be a family thing, but mostly from the kids' perspective, but also from the perspective of parents who would play along with it?  I dunno, the program itself seems confused as to who it's for...",0.9222,179
