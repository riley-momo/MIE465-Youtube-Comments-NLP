"And how bad is he? 

Besides saying stupid shit and not knowing how to keep his twitter fingers at bay he’s actually doing fine tbh. I think people bash Trump’s actual presidency nowadays because they think it makes them look like they know politics. Or they’re so liberally blind they don’t see how they’re being controlled by all the propaganda and biased networks (that benefited most from net neutrality but you won’t see that covered amongst all the republican hate) 

I’m getting $6,000 more back this year on my tax return where I was paying 40% as a middle class citizen. Sounds good to me. 

Perhaps people would like Obama back who backpedaled on FDA and food corporations because they threatened to pull donations. Or who hired the people who caused the economic collapse. 

The whole electoral process is a joke but I’d probably still be against Hillary. I think people need to start admitting Trump isn’t as bad as everyone thought he’d be.

Time to take the tinfoil hat off and stop the confirmation biased research about conspiracy theories of Russian collusion. Start looking at what he’s ACTUALLY doing. Unless, of course, you can’t see past the liberal conjecture painted as facts on every other conversation or documentary such as ‘Greed’.",-0.962,256
