"The problem with hydrophobic fabric treatments is that they wear off after a while. Unless the textile itself has hydrophobic properties the bag will not remain ""spill proof"" for a very long period of time. Something else to consider is that spill proof does not mean dirt proof, and hydrophobic coatings can be difficult to wash without destroying the treatment. Finally, it's not clear if the zipper has a water proof seal, or what happens if a liquid spills inside your bag.",-0.3451,91
