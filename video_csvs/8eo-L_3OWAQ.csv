The Lord loves you! He is not angry at you, neither does He hate you!

Repent of your sins and put your faith in Jesus!
He will FORGIVE you and DELIVER you from the oncoming judgement that's quickly approaching this earth, because He already took our punishment on the cross by dying for us! THANK YOU, JESUS!
He rose the 3rd day, assuring us of our redemption! Hallelujah!

This is how much The God of the universe loves us. So find rest, comfort and peace in this Holy Truth.

Don't listen to the devils lies, just come to Jesus today! He promises He will never drive anyone away when they come to Him!
All those that call upon The Lord from the heart will be saved, so you do not need a fancy prayer to speak to Jesus. Just speak from the heart; be real with The Lord, and He will be real with you! Hallelujah!

Shalom, friends. I pray you make today the day that you make Jesus your Lord and Savior, because to die without Jesus is very dangerous, friends.",0.9902,220
