And that could very well explain the uncomfortableness of Rian Johnson and the cast at the question, because if they tried and couldn't make it happen, they don't want to look like they're throwing him under the bus. Better (it seems) to let Johnson take the heat for just leaving him out than to say ""your idol can't cut it any more."" Let the legend live on, and let the new guy fall on the sword.
